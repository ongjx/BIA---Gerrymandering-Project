# BIA---Gerrymandering-Project

A Business Intelligence Analytics Project to determine/investigate whether there is proof of the Singapore government carrying out gerrymandering in order to ensure a win in elections.

We consolidated household and demographic data from the 2011 and 2015 General Elections to determine if such a correlation exists.

We then extrapolate these predictions for the upcoming 2020 Elections.
