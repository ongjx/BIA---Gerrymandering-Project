range issues as well as immediate challenges which Singaporeans face .', 'From a national perspective , Singapore has done very well .', 'Over the last five years , we ran into the worst storm we have ever encountered since independence .', 'But we took bold and decisive measures , especially the Resilience Package and the Jobs Credit .', 'The measures worked and sheltered us from the worst of the storm .', 'If you look and compare today with five years ago , I think we can honestly say incomes have gone up some , people have jobs and homes , our city has been upgraded and Singapore is better .', 'But unfortunately , it was such a powerful storm that even with a big and strong umbrella , we could not avoid getting a little bit wet .', 'So Singaporeans felt the discomfort , the anxiety - compounded because of the rapid changes which we could not predict and which left us worrying what tomorrow would bring .', 'After the crisis passed , our economy bounced back faster than we had expected , which should be good news but it also brought its own problems .', 'Our infrastructure programmes could not quite catch up , there was a shortage in our housing programme , and people became very anxious over their HDB flats .', 'Our public transport became a bit more crowded than it should be and people noticed .', 'From a personal perspective , many citizens feel pressure in their daily lives even though you see the growth figures .', 'Last year 14 . 5 per cent ; this year so far , nearly five per cent , and they ask themselves , why has my cost of living gone up ?', 'Can I or my children afford to buy homes for ourselves ?', 'What about my healthcare costs as I grow old ?', 'In short , Singapore may be progressing , the country may be moving forward , but am I part of this progress , am I part of this story ?', 'I can fully understand and empathise with these concerns because it has been a difficult ride - bumpy , stormy and causing anxiety from time to time .', 'But we are tackling these problems , building more flats , improving our public transport , managing the inflow of foreign workers and immigrants .', 'It will take a while to solve these problems because they are big and complicated issues , but we are heading in the right direction and things will gradually get better .', 'So , please be patient and at the same time , please try and look beyond these problems which we can see as immediate concerns and look to longer - term , wider world issues which affect us and are of strategic importance to us .', 'We have got to implement long - term policies to keep Singapore growing because otherwise , without the right long - term strategy , there will be no Singapore success story for any Singapore citizen to be part of .', 'Our outlook

the Democrats on one side and the Republicans on the other as to what to do .', 'One side wants to make sure taxes are never raised , the other side wants to make sure benefits are never cut .',

is only a reflection of the real issue and the real issue is that investors around the world lack confidence that these governments will be able to make the hard decisions and to resolve the problems which are deep and very serious .', 'In Asia , with this global backdrop , China , India and the emerging markets are doing quite well but if America and Europe go into another recession , then I think China and India and the emerging economies will also be affected and vulnerable .', 'Therefore , Singapore has to be watchful .', 'We do not have to press the panic button yet but we have to be

energy and concern .', 'People are focused on the issues , so let us harness this energy to make Singapore stronger but let it not divide our society .', 'My government will reach out to all segments of Singapore society to understand your perspectives , to share ideas and concerns with you , to work with you to come up with plans and programmes which will benefit all of us .', 'I think there are many concerned Singaporeans who are thinking about this , even after the elections , with critical but thoughtful views .', 'They do not agree with everything the government has done or is doing but they acknowledge the good work and the progress and they are concerned that we should make things better and not throw the baby out with the bath water .', 'A good number of people like this have written to MPs , to ministers .', 'I have received quite a number myself - thoughtful , cogent presentations of why they think things turned out as they did , and what they think we should do now .', 'I think that people like this give hope that Singaporeans want the country to progress and prove that there are people who are prepared to come forward and to make our system work better .', 'I encourage all those who have written to us in this spirit to come forward , whether online or in real life , and help to strengthen the constructive climate of opinion so that your government can do right for you and do right for Singapore .', 'I think in person or face to face on TV , we know how to do it .', 'But engagement online , I think we need to learn to do it better .', 'It is not easy to do but it is important because the digital media is continuing to grow in importance .', 'Five years ago YouTube was insignificant , Facebook did not exist ; all you had was mrbrown .', 'Today mrbrown has a lot of competition .', 'We in government have a lot of competition and we have to be able to operate in that space .', 'It is not easy because it is anonymous , it is chaotic , it is unfiltered , unmoderated and so the medium lends itself to many negative views and ridiculous untruths , any number of them .', 'I will not repeat one because otherwise you may misunderstand and think it is true .', 'But if you just open at random , you will see them and we have to do our best to counter this , to prevent untruths from circulating and being repeated five , 10 , 20 times from leading people astray .', 'After a while , you have heard it so often , you cannot remember where you saw it but you think that it must be true .', 'But it is not .', 'Our ministers have to get better at this and you know many ministers are blogging now , interacting on Facebook etc .', 'They have to communicate in a different medium and convey nuance , policy , intentions and explanations in a more personal way by engaging people .', 'But it is not just the ministers doing this , the government as a whole has to be more active and adept in engaging Singaporeans online .', 'We cannot be in every corner of cyberspace because there are a lot of cowboy towns out there but there must be places which grow , where people recognise are reliable , where you can have an open debate where different views are expressed ; but it is balanced and if you go there , you know that to start off with , you can assume that it will make sense .', 'Whether it is right or wrong , you have to consider the arguments but it is not rubbish .', 'We have got to get there , be in cyberspace and use it constructively to explain issues , to shape opinions , to rally support and to make Singapore work better .', 'I am very encouraged that Singaporeans are engaging but I am even more encouraged that they are going beyond giving views in order to come forward and to actually work with one another and with the government on projects which matter to them and which are good for Singapore .', 'I will give you a couple of examples because I think that is the most vivid way to convey the things which Singaporeans are getting together and doing and getting mobilised on .', 'One of them is the KTM railway line , the land we took back on July 1 and on which we are creating a green corridor along the railway .', 'There are many views outside encouraging the government to make this a beautiful green corridor , to add to the amenities of living in Singapore .', 'MND , URA and me , we are very keen on this , so URA has been carrying out an extensive public consultation .', 'Khaw Boon Wan is in charge but Tan Chuan Jin has been personally focused on this and talking to the different nature groups and civic groups outside , looking for creative ways to preserve the green spaces without affecting the development potential of the land which can be developed , because there are lands which can be developed and which should be developed because they are very valuable .', 'But a strip of the railway , I think we can do something interesting with that .', 'We have got many bright ideas , some from students , some from architects , some from design professionals and they sent them to us .', 'They want to use some sections as creative arts and performing spaces .', 'They want to develop a leisure corridor , link them to our park connector network and there are some pictures which you can see .', 'This is Sungei Pang Sua , this is a canal .', 'The actual railway line is just beyond the trees but we can transform this and here is one proposal , to make it look like this .', 'The amenities will be for the residents , for Singaporeans .', 'The canal becomes a meandering stream and the houses behind - their property value is likely to go up .', 'But I think that is good .', 'There is another proposal from a recent architecture graduate from NUS , Ms Regina Koo , who put some effort into designing a project also around the same area .', 'Her proposal is to build this structure which she calls a â \\x80\\x9c Velo Parkâ \\x80\\x9d, which means it is a centre for bicycle activities .', 'You have bikeways , you have bicycle rental stalls , a club , a bike cafÃ ©, you can go in and have a bite on your bike .', 'It is creative , it is imaginative and I hope we get many more bright ideas like this and then we will have a range , a menu to choose from .', 'When we have a decision taken and the plans are settled , I hope the interest groups which are engaged in this will actively participate in implementing the projects .', 'So do not just tell us what to do , help us to do it .', 'This is one interesting project .', 'Another interesting project is the Yellow Ribbon Project which you will have probably heard of , and its objective is to help to rehabilitate ex - offenders , people who are released from prison , and to lower the re - offence rate which we have done quite successfully .', 'In fact we have the lowest re - offending rate probably in the world .', 'There are more than 900 volunteers who give their time and energy , who work closely with government agencies to do this Yellow Ribbon Project .', 'One of the volunteers , Mr Philip Tan , had an idea to do this particular project .', 'If you read it , it says â \\x80\\x9c Dining Behind Barsâ \\x80\\x9d.', 'That means for the public to go to prison , to have lunch inside the prison .', 'First you have to go through the bars , these are the guests arriving and the inmates will prepare the meal for you .', 'It is not just a prison meal , it is a special meal because they are being guided by the MediaCorpâ \\x80\\x99 s â \\x80\\x9c Chef for Hireâ \\x80\\x9d Ryan Hong .', 'Then they eat in style , this is inside the prison and the room is called the Changi Tea Room and this is the chef , Ryan Hong , who masterminded it .', 'You see at the back of the room , they have some pictures .', 'Those are artworks done by the prisoners .', 'After the meal , they have an auction of the artworks .', 'The end result - raise money for the Yellow Ribbon Fund and also let the public know that our inmates are working hard to rehabilitate themselves and that they deserve a second chance .', 'This is the sort of thing which the government cannot do very well by itself as a government department .', 'We can facilitate it , we can encourage it but you need people with a passion who will put their heart and soul into it and dream up new ideas like this .', 'So that is what we are looking for .', 'Not everything can be done through such volunteer efforts and in government , not every policy can go through extensive consultation .', 'Sometimes , the government just has to deliberate and decide because it is sensitive or there is no time or is an issue where the government has to make up its mind .', 'For example , when it has to do with national security or during crises , you cannot go round asking people what to do .', 'The government has to carry the can .', 'Also even after discussion , we will not always be able to reach agreement or consensus and having heard all the views , the government would have to do what it considers right for the country and then take responsibility for its decision .', 'Matters can be big or small .', 'We receive many requests every day and not every request to the government can be fulfilled .', 'It could be just to waive a traffic fine or a library fine , it could be just to give a person in the queue priority over other persons in the queue .', 'We may or may not be able to satisfy such requests but whether we can or cannot say yes , we must always maintain courtesy and mutual respect when we discuss these issues .', 'Government departments have to do that , frontline staff have to do that and every day , our frontline staff in the government departments deal with thousands of Singaporeans .', 'Our teachers in schools , our HDB staff at the counters and in the area offices , our town council staff , our hospital staff , PA and the community centres - thousands , if not tens of thousands , of engagements .', 'Most members of the public will be civil and I think most of the time it works well .', 'But some people will press hard and some can be quite demanding .', 'And the agencies tell me that such cases of people being demanding have grown more common in the last few months .', 'And the frontline staff are feeling under pressure .', 'For example there was one person who went to a government department and at the counter , he wanted something , he could not get it and this is what he told the staff .', 'He said , â \\x80\\x9c I donâ \\x80\\x99 t care what your policies and rules are , your job is to make sure that I qualify as a special case .', 'Find the rules , find the right rule to make sure that I am a special case and I want you to do it nowâ \\x80\\x9d.', 'Now , how would you feel if you were at the counter dealing with this case ?', 'How should you react ?', 'Can you really say yes ?', 'Can the government say yes ?', 'Then what happens when the next person comes and says I also want a special rule ?', 'So we have to be able to manage such cases .', 'I encourage the frontline staff : do your best , be firm , fair , courteous , even when under pressure .', 'Your job is not easy but it is an important job .', 'Do it well , and we will back you up .', 'I hope the public will also be civil even when you do not get what you are asking for because with restraint and good sense on both sides , we can solve more problems and we can strengthen the relationship between the people and the government .', 'But beyond attending to matters like this , I encourage Singaporeans to come forward to play a larger and positive role .', 'To sort out issues and compromises together without getting the government , without needing the government to get into the loop .', 'Best of all to take the initiative yourself and to make something happen and to make a difference to the lives of others .', 'One good example of this which I cannot resist showing you is a young man who is a photographer , his name is Sam Kangli and he lives in an HDB block in Tampines .', 'And he realised that his neighbours may see each other every day but they do not really know each other that well , and Kangli is in the audience .', 'So he took the initiative to take family portraits of his neighbours at their doorsteps to help them get to know one another .', 'And here are some of the pictures .', 'So through this exercise taking pictures , he succeeded in breaking the ice and now when the neighbours meet one another they acknowledge one another , they greet one another , there is more small talk in the block and when he comes back and gets back from work , the neighbours who happen to be going out will tell him come , take my parking lot , it is free .', 'So this is Kangli here who took all these pictures .', 'So I think we look forward to many more examples of active citizenship like this .', 'We are a young nation and we are to develop and to mature , we have to harness our diverse views and ideas , put aside our personal interests and forge common goals .', 'Come to some agreement that this is something worth doing together â \\x80\\x93 let us make it happen .', 'And we need active citizens to change our community for the better .', 'So work with us , make it happen , stand up and do our part to shape Singaporeâ \\x80\\x99 s future .', 'If we get this basic working relationship right , then we can get our policies right .', 'I think by and large our policies , the major ones in Singapore , are headed in the right direction .', 'They may need fine - tuning , adjusting ; the rough edges have to be smoothed off but we are heading in the right way .', 'I would like to use two examples tonight of broad policy areas to give you a sense of how we should maintain our direction at the same time as we make this adjustment .', 'One of these policies is foreign workers and immigrants .', 'It is not easy to maintain because these are policies where the benefits are there but they are long term , whereas the downsides are immediate , the side effects are visible and people react to them and we have to respond to this .', 'The foreign workers and immigrants we have taken have given us considerable benefits .', 'Our economy has grown , our population has increased but over the last few years , the changes have been taking place quite fast and Singaporeans worry about the impact on them .', 'Last year I spoke of this at length in the Rally , so I will not repeat the explanations which I gave you , hopefully you remember what I said last year .', 'I think Singaporeans understand the logic of the policy but the emotional impact , they still feel that and that still causes worry and concern .', 'So I empathise with this and we are acting to relieve the pressures and to make clear that we are putting Singaporeans first .', 'Tonight , what I would like to explain is not the basic rationale which I think you know but to talk about three further areas where we can help Singaporeans to cope with these issues and the consequences of these issues â \\x80\\x93 housing , education and jobs .', 'Let me start with housing .', 'I think it is at the top of a lot of peopleâ \\x80\\x99 s minds .', 'It is a key expression of putting Singaporeans first .', 'Our home ownership policy ensures that every family has a stake in Singapore .', 'But in the last two years , with property prices going up , spiking up sharply , many people have become unsettled .', 'Young couples especially because they want to get married , they want to book a flat , they want to start their family and no flat means baby is put off .', 'Or worse , they fear they would not be able to afford the homes when they finally get the flat .', 'So HDB is building many more flats .', 'This year 25 , 000 BTO flats and I think in recent tenders or recent BTO exercises , the ratio of applicants to flats has gradually been coming down .', 'And we will keep on putting out the supply onto the market .', 'One group who is most worried is those who are earning just below $ 8 , 000 .', 'It is just below the income ceiling and they fear that they may breach the ceiling .', 'There are more such couples now because people are getting married later , so they are applying for flats when they are more senior in their careers , so their incomes have gone up .', 'There are more women who are working so the family income has also gone up and so they are quite worried because if they are earning $ 7 , 500 and you get a promotion , you are not sure whether that is good news or bad news because you may get promoted to $ 8 , 500 and then you have to write an appeal to your MP before they get their HDB flat .', 'We have been studying this for some time , so what we will do is we will raise the HDB ceiling for income per household from $ 8 , 000 to $ 10 , 000 .', 'And for executive condominiums where the ceiling is $ 10 , 000 now , we will raise that to $ 12 , 000 .', 'So we will bring more people into the HDB net and you do not have to worry so much .', 'But the result of bringing more people into the HDB net is that there is going to be more demand for the BTO flats .', 'We have got to make sure that HDB builds enough flats to cope with this extra demand .', 'I have discussed this with Khaw Boon Wan and he has talked to his staff and next year , HDB will be able to build another 25 , 000 BTO flats , same as this year .', 'And that is a big number .', 'He is quite confident that with these measures , we can meet the demand and we can keep the price of new flats stable and affordable .', 'However , there is a minority of Singaporeans who cannot afford to purchase flats , cannot afford home ownership and they will need rental flats .', 'We know this and we are increasing the supply of rental flats .', 'Over the next two years , we will add 7 , 000 rental flats to our supply so we can cater to more families who need this help .', 'We are also postponing the demolition of some SERS blocks so that we can use them as temporary rental units because when you do a SERS project , you build a new block , you move the people from the old block into the new blocks and the old blocks can be demolished and redeveloped in due course .', 'But instead of demolishing them now , we can use them as temporary rental flats until we can relieve the pressure on rentals and we can do the redevelopment a little bit later on .', 'And I think all these measures will ease the waiting time and make things better for households who may be very anxious to get a solution to their housing problems .', 'But I should say that building more rental flats is not really the most fundamental solution to the problems which these households face because their problems are really upstream .', 'They have run into financial difficulties or their families have split up , or there have been some gambling or some business failure , and so as a result they have cashed out on their flat which they already own and now they want a rental flat as another safety net .', 'This is something that we have to study and address because these are deeper social issues , not so easy to solve .', 'But overall , I promise you we will keep housing available and affordable for Singaporeans .', 'So the first thing we are making a move on is housing .', 'Another area where we need to make some adjustment is university education , university places .', 'Education is one of the issues which is at the top of nearly every Singaporeanâ \\x80\\x99 s minds ; a passionate concern , whether you are a student mugging for the next exam , trying to get into the next institution , next school or you are a parent , kan cheong , worrying about your kid .', 'The university term has just begun and this year a record number of Singaporeans are going to universities in Singapore â \\x80\\x93 12 , 000 .', 'One in four students of every cohort , every person that age , is going to university .', 'We have never had so many or so big a proportion and I congratulate all of them and their parents for doing well and for taking this significant step in their education .', 'But even then , not all those who applied could be admitted and not all those who got into university got their first choice of course because the competition for courses , the competition for places in some courses , is very intense .', 'For example , in the medical school here in NUS , we have 300 places for medical students but 2 , 000 students applied to do medical school , and all of them have outstanding results : three As , four As , CCA , secondment , internship , all sorts , whatever is necessary to improve their chances , they have done it .', 'But there is no way that we can take 2 , 000 so unfortunately quite a number had to be disappointed and we received many appeals from parents and students .', 'I got one myself whom I met in my meet - the - people session and she came to see me .', 'I said good evening , she said good morning .', 'Why ?', 'Because she had waited for me and it was about 12 . 30am by the time she saw me .', 'But it was that important to her , she made the effort .', 'I get many emails , so have the ministers .', 'I like to quote from one , written by a mother of a student trying to get into university .', 'She wrote a long email but I will just quote one section .', 'She said , â \\x80\\x9c I am very saddened by all the statements made in the general election about â \\x80\\x9c Singaporeans firstâ \\x80\\x9d.', 'I am not asking for financial help nor housing nor complaining about GST or cost of living .', 'What I am asking for is a place for my child to further his education .', 'Why do not you give him a chance ? â \\x80\\x9d So it is a heartfelt plea which I think many parents will empathise with and which we feel too because we read all these appeals and we understand how the parents passionately want the best for their kids .', 'Even so , unfortunately not all the appeals succeeded although this one did .', 'The son was interviewed by NTU , eventually admitted - but I should explain , on his own merits and not because of special intervention by me .', 'But for those who did not get in , my advice is : do not give up .', 'There are many different pathways up , we are providing a good education for all our students , whether or not you go to university or poly or the ITE , or you go to work , and later on you advance into the university - there are many opportunities to keep upgrading yourselves , not just once - off but all your lives .', 'And whichever way you go , do your best , do well because that way you open up more opportunities and that way I think you make it easier for us to help you .', 'One unhappiness is the feeling that maybe foreign students have taken the place of locals in the universities because our universities do take a proportion of foreign students .', 'Right now they have about 18 per cent foreign students but I should say that these foreign students have not been at the expense of the local student intake because we have steadily increased the number of places for Singaporeans in our universities .', 'So if you look at it , ten years ago , we only had 9 , 000 students in the universities , Singapore students , as I told you just now , we have 12 , 000 , more than ever .', 'And it is the result of our investments , our programmes to build and our determination to provide as many places as possible for Singaporeans and the best experience for the students who go to university .', 'There are many benefits for the local students to have foreign classmates .', 'It prepares them better for the global workplace , it exposes them to the competition and makes them , spurs them to work harder and give their best and quite often the local and the foreign students will even partner and make new start - ups .', 'And here is one example of a start - up done by local and foreign NUS students .', 'The company is called BioMers .', 'It produces translucent braces , orthodontic braces , this is the thing they are making and you cannot see it on the teeth because it is meant to be invisible so you can look beautiful or handsome even while you straighten your teeth .', 'The key people in this project are three Singaporeans .', 'The two girls in front : Renuga , who did the research ; Karen , who was a research assistant , helped her to do it , both from NUS .', 'Then Mervyn who was also from NUS , knew of this , went to the UK to study , and there he met George , and George is very interesting because George is a Canadian Greek and the two of them developed the technology further to make it commercialisable .', 'They came back and they started the company , and they brought in Bindu who is also an NUS student and he comes from India and so this multinational team set up a start - up .', 'The startup now has 26 staff and more than half of the staff are Singaporeans .', 'When you have this international mix in our universities , it is good for our students .', 'We have got to keep on doing this but we also have to strike the right balance between the local and foreign students .', 'We take in 12 , 000 Singapore students annually now at our universities and we are going to expand the intakes further considerably .', 'Over the next four years , we will expand university intakes by 2 , 000 university places , and that is a lot of places because the whole of Singapore Management University only takes about 1 , 700 students each year .', 'We are talking about one extra SMU - plusâ \\x80\\x99 intake over the next four years and all 2 , 000 additional places will go to Singapore students .', 'By 2015 our universities will take in 14 , 000 Singapore students , more than ever before .', 'But while we do this , we will cap the foreign enrolment at the present levels and therefore gradually the mix will shift and the proportion of foreign students will come down .', 'But this is not the end point because we continue to develop beyond this and beyond 2015 , I believe the universities should expand their enrolments further because the economy will need more graduates and our schools and our polys are producing more students with good results and many of our students passionately want to go to university and have the grades and the capability to benefit from a university education .', 'I think we should allow as many as possible to have that opportunity .', 'MOE is studying how best to do this - may not be just from expanding the existing universities , maybe we have to open new routes .', 'It is something we should study further .', 'But whether it is houses , whether it is university , whether it is jobs , which I am coming to next , we put Singaporeans first but in an open - minded sort of way .', 'For jobs , we have let in a steady inflow of foreign workers into our economy at all levels and because of that , our economy has thrived and we have full employment - everybody has a job .', 'All Singaporeans , nearly every Singaporean is working .', 'Unemployment is only about 2 . 2 per cent overall but still I know that Singaporeans worry about competition from foreigners .', 'Sometime ago I had a dialogue with young people and one polytechnic student asked me this very direct question .', 'He said : â \\x80\\x9c You know you have the â \\x80\\x98 Sâ \\x80\\x99 pass for people who are one level above the work permit .', 'Why do you set the S pass qualifying salary at $ 1 , 800 ? â \\x80\\x9d Why did he ask me that question ?', 'Because really what he meant was $ 1 , 800 is less than what many poly diploma holders are earning .', 'Poly diploma holders earn more than that .', 'If you set the level there , you are going to have people who will be earning less than us but competing against us , so why do you let the foreigner compete directly against me ?', 'I understand those feelings but we need some non - Singaporeans to complement the Singaporeans and to make up our shortfall .', 'But at the same time , we also realise that it is important that Singaporeans remain the core of our workforce .', 'We cannot become like the Gulf states where 80 per cent of the people who are working are foreigners and if you go there , whether it is the person in the hotel , whether it is the bank , whether it is the airport counter , or any of the jobs , it is foreigners working and we cannot be like that .', 'We have tightened up on foreigners progressively .', 'We have tightened up the foreign workers levy , we have tightened up on the dependency ratios .', 'The â \\x80\\x98 Sâ \\x80\\x99 pass we have pushed from $ 1 , 800 to $ 2 , 000 , that is of some help to the poly diploma holders and people who are at that level and therefore we have protected Singaporean workers , especially at the lower end .', 'But we also have to be mindful of the impact on companies , especially local SMEs , because they need the foreign workers the most and if we squeeze out the foreign workers too drastically , we are going to kill the SMEs .', 'We are helping the SMEs to adjust : grants , tax deductions , all sorts of schemes to help them to upgrade their productivity and we have to bear that in mind when we settle our policies .', 'At the top end of the workforce , we have to allow high quality professionals and entrepreneurs because they grow our businesses here and help Singapore compete internationally .', 'If you look at what we are doing , at the bottom , we are tightening ; at the top we have to be free .', 'In between we have to make some adjustments .', 'The middle , the lower middle level - foreigners are here , many on employment pass .', 'Singaporeans are working - they are probably graduates or diploma holders , not hard up , not unskilled but not so confident of themselves that they are ready for unrestrained competition .', 'They are feeling vulnerable , worried about what may happen .', 'I think at this middle level , we need to tighten a little bit further .', 'We need to raise the salary requirement for the employment pass holders , tighten up the educational qualifications , make sure they come with real skills valuable to us and this is something MOM has worked on and will announce details soon .', 'MOM will also work with tripartite partners , so as to develop guidelines for fair employment practices and responsible recruitment practices so that when you have a Singaporean working side by side with a foreigner , they both feel fairly treated and nobody feels that he is at a disadvantage .', 'This is something which we will work together with the unions and employers .', 'But I should caution you on one thing - just because we are tightening on foreign workers does not automatically mean that Singaporeans will get better jobs or higher pay because the competition is not just the foreign worker here .', 'You are competing with workers all over the world .', 'Unskilled workers have felt this for a long time but increasingly our graduates and professionals are also seeing this happen .', 'In China every year seven million graduates graduate from university , double the number of Singaporeans .', 'Of these , 1 . 5 million are engineering and science types .', 'They are hungry , they are competitive and they are competing furiously with one another in China and I think the impact will be felt around the world for the next 20 years , including us .', 'It is really a tidal wave , a tsunami coming in our direction and the only way to get out of the trouble is to rise above the tsunami by training ourselves , developing expertise and doing things which they cannot do yet in China but which we can do now in Singapore so that we can make a living for ourselves in order to improve our lives .', 'But even if we do that , we have to accept that if we bring down the number of foreigners , slow the inflow , it means slower growth , less economic growth , somewhat less vitality , companies will come here not so vigorously or they may choose to expand elsewhere and we will have less resources to improve our lives .', 'You have got to find the right balance .', 'Yes we will moderate and manage the foreign workers but we have to bring in enough so that we have the manpower and the talent to grow and to prosper .', 'This is what we must do when it comes to putting Singaporeans first , stay open but moderate our policies , solve the problems , whether it is housing , whether it is education , whether it is jobs .', 'It has worked , we have brought global winners here and we have created prosperity for Singaporeans .', 'One example of this is Lucasfilm Singapore .', 'Last year I talked about them but I think this year there is something interesting to share with you again .', 'Lucasfilm in Singapore has 500 employees from 36 countries ; nearly half of them are Singaporeans , skilled people , animators , visual effect artistes , engineers .', 'Many of them graduated from our polys which have very good digital arts and digital animation courses and the team here has helped to produce many successful movies .', 'I showed you â \\x80\\x9c Clone Warsâ \\x80\\x9d two years ago but the latest movie which we have been working on here is â \\x80\\x9c Transformers 3 : Dark of the Moonâ \\x80\\x9d and I will show you just one short clip done jointly by the team here and the team in San Francisco .', 'Those of you who watched Transformers movies will know that this is a movie clip of Bumblebee : 10 seconds on the screen or eight seconds on the screen but more than 10 people worked on it - layout , simulation , animation , lighting , all kinds of skills , highly - refined .', 'This is only possible because you have this very diverse team with all the people from all around the world put together to make it happen .', 'Let us stay open , keep current with new ideas and trends , stay ahead of the competition and let us stay a confident , forward looking and successful society .', 'The second area of policy which I would like to share with you to show how we are keeping our direction while adjusting our implementation is our social safety nets - how we need to care for one another .', 'We are living in a time of rapid changes .', 'Last five years you have seen the changes .', 'Over the next five years , I think there will be many unexpected surprises to come and it is important that nobody is left behind as we dodge and shift and find our way through the troubles .', 'We aim for inclusive economic growth .', 'We want to encourage people to be self - reliant , for families to give mutual support to one another and to be able to look after themselves as much as possible , but there will be a minority who cannot keep up or who will fall on hard times .', 'For them , we need a social safety net .', 'The way we have done it which I think has been successful has been to give people assets , especially an HDB flat ; help them become self - reliant by giving them a very good education , provide them affordable medical care through the 3Ms - MediShield , Medisave , Medifund â \\x80\\x93 and also government subsidies through the hospitals , and then to have targeted assistance to those who need help through many helping hands .', 'The result is that nearly all citizens are employed , housed and able to look after themselves .', 'The last five years have been stressful and so we have introduced new programmes which have helped - Workfare to raise the incomes of lower income Singaporeans , Comcare to provide tailored support for individuals and families with specific needs .', 'Since we introduced Comcare six years ago , we have had 200 , 000 people helped by the schemes .', 'So we have got a blossoming of all kinds of local programmes involving community leaders , the grassroots groups , the VWOs , doing interesting things on their own initiative with government support and backing .', 'For example , they distribute food to needy households or they teach low income families budgeting skills .', 'This is not Monopoly , this is called â \\x80\\x9c Moneywiseâ \\x80\\x9d and it is a programme introduced by Southeast CDC to teach low income families how to manage and budget their money and is quite successful in getting them to be able to save , to allocate and to learn how to cope .', 'Or we have people who are befriending the elderly , taking them on outings .', 'This is a group who took wheelchair - bound elderly to Marina Bay , I do not think to the casino .', 'Or maybe you just take them out for a meal and enjoy some companionship together in a hawker centre and cheer up their day , add some warmth and brightness to their lives .', 'That is how I think we can make a big difference to the lives of Singaporeans who need help .', 'The next five years - there is going to be rapid change .', 'Our aging population is going to throw up new challenges and there will be other groups which will have specific needs which we have got to tackle .', 'We will keep on improving our social safety net , enhancing it , keep the present approach but improve the schemes and I would like to talk about two things which we will be doing tonight .', 'One is to do with medical care and particularly with outpatient treatment , especially for older people .', 'Many Singaporeans worry about medical expenses , especially if you are older or you have an elderly member in your family .', 'The 3M framework , Medisave and so on , works well for inpatient care but for outpatient treatment , I think we can do better .', 'One group of these elderly is those who need long term care .', 'They may be bed - ridden or they may have Alzheimerâ \\x80\\x99 s and I talked in the Chinese speech just now of some of the things we are doing to help this group .', 'We will give more support , expand services , make the services more affordable .', 'Another group is patients who have chronic ailments , maybe high cholesterol , maybe high blood pressure , maybe diabetes and amongst the people who are in their 70s maybe half will have one chronic ailment or another .', 'When you have something like this , you will know that you need regular checkups and you need long term medication .', 'It is not that you take the pill 10 days and the problem is cured .', 'You have these pills , take it for the rest of your life , every three or six months see the doctor , the doctor will examine you , adjust the dosage , six months later see again .', 'Try and keep well for as long as you can .', 'But the pills can be expensive , particularly over a long period of time and the low income patients tell me they may skip an appointment because they fear they cannot afford the pills .', 'Or they may say â \\x80\\x9c the doctor says I eat this every day but I take it every other day instead to save moneyâ \\x80\\x9d, which is not the way it is supposed to be done because if you do that , your condition will worsen and more trouble will come later on , serious complications .', 'I think that we should make outpatient care more affordable and accessible for this group : the elderly and the not so elderly .', 'We have a scheme to help elderly chronic patients like this .', 'It is called the Primary Care Partnership Scheme ( PCPS ), which helps the low income elderly and disabled .', 'What it means is : you have a card , you are registered , you can see your GP instead of going to the polyclinic but you get a subsidy like you are going to the polyclinic .', 'It is more convenient , you have more choices and you probably get faster service .', 'We will change this scheme which is now quite restrictive and where you have to be 65 years old before you are considered for this scheme .', 'We will change it so that you can start at the age of 40 .', 'Because when you have high blood pressure or cholesterol or diabetes , by the age of 40 it is beginning to show up particularly if you have not looked after yourself .', 'When you have conditions like this , the earlier you start treating , the better I think the results will be and you have to cooperate and we will improve the scheme to help you to be able to have consistent treatment over a long period of time .', 'We will also revise the income criteria to include more households so that a broader range of households can come in under the scheme and can get consistent good long term care .', 'We will also make the medication more affordable to lower income households .', 'We will expand the drug list so that it covers more drugs and we will increase subsidies for the more expensive drugs with safeguards so that those with chronic ailments or cancer where chemotherapy can be very expensive , well you will get more help .', 'I think these are major moves .', 'We will implement them carefully and as we gain experience with them , we can consider how to fine - tune and how we can take further steps forward .', 'We have to be very careful because you do not want to end up like the Americans where the government health schemes have eaten up a huge amount of the budget and financially and fiscally it is a big problem for them .', 'But we can do better , we will do better and MOH is working on it and they will announce the details later on .', 'So this is one area where we can improve our social safety nets .', 'The other area has to do with families who have children with special needs .', 'They may have dyslexia , they may have autism .', 'They may be ESN , they may be hearing impaired or one of so many conditions but they have long - term special care and education needs .', 'The families will worry not just over the cost but also about helping them overcome their disabilities and develop to the maximum , so that they get the right stimulation , right education and training , right coping strategies .', 'The government is already supporting people doing this .', 'We support early intervention , we support special education schools .', 'We also have support in mainstream schools for children with mild learning disabilities like dyslexia .', 'The special education schools are doing good work .', 'One example is Pathlight School which happens to be in Teck Ghee .', 'It looks a beautiful building and it is for children with autism , now it has got about 600 students .', 'I know because I visited it and I held my National Day observance there this year recently .', 'These are the Pathlight students performing and they presented me a beautiful drawing .', 'It is a drawing of Joo Chiat shophouses done by one of their students .', 'So it shows that you may be a special education student but you can have very special abilities too .', 'And in the right environment , they can thrive .', 'But there is a long queue for places in some of the special education schools , and I often meet parents asking me for help to get their children in .', 'So we will expand capacity in the special education schools and also in the mainstream schools and we will strive to raise the quality of the special education schools so that the children get education which will help them to overcome their disabilities .', 'We will also increase financial assistance for households who need more help .', 'This is something which the Ministry of Education will do together with MCYS , consulting the community to work out the best approach because this is something which needs many helping hands .', 'The community has to play its part to help to integrate those with special needs into our society .', 'And one good example of a ground - up effort , not depending on the government , is the Joan Bowen cafÃ ©.', 'Joan Bo Wen is a young lady with special needs .', 'Her parents wanted to solve her problem ; they wanted a safe working environment for her .', 'So what did they do ?', 'They opened a cafÃ © and they called it the Joan Bowen cafÃ ©.', 'The cafÃ © is at Jalan Wangi which is in Sennett Estate and it is to help youths with special needs like autism or Downâ \\x80\\x99 s Syndrome so it has got a crew of 16 staff of such kids , actually adults , and they are trained to run the whole cafÃ ©.', 'Here you see them cooking and this is Joan in the middle , putting the sauce onto the dish .', 'They learn food preparation because they have a manual with pictures and detailed instructions - exactly how to do , each step what to put next and with patient guidance , gradually they gain confidence and they are able to serve customers .', 'You see the customers are happy and the cafÃ © is successful , so they have launched a second outlet at St Andrewâ \\x80\\x99 s Village .', 'So if you have a chance and you live near there , please drop in and have a drink .', 'So we will do our part as the government but the community , parents , VWOs please come forward , help us to carry this and deal with this challenge .', 'You can do a lot .', 'We will progressively improve our social safety nets , update our basic schemes whether it is the CPF , whether it is the Medisave schemes and so on .', 'And we will do more for other groups which have special needs as these issues emerge and we will keep up our effort to help the poor , make sure that nobody is left behind .', 'But while we do all these things , we have to be very careful that we do not become a welfare state .', 'Take the example of Greece , you know it is in trouble but why is it in trouble ?', 'It is a small country , population is about twice ours , the GDP is about twice ours and its former prime minister Papandreou - a generation ago he built a generous welfare system , protecting the Greeks from competition , giving them jobs in the government , welfare benefits , pension benefits , but it was not affordable .', 'And so the country has gone broke and has been set back for many decades .', 'Now Papandreou Jr , the son , is trying to wind back these benefits and put the country right again .', 'It is very painful , it is going to be very , very difficult and even then they cannot do it by themselves .', 'They are being bailed out by the EU , so far twice , and the problem is not settled .', 'In Greece , if you run into trouble , the EU is there to look after you .', 'In Singapore , if we run into trouble , who is going to be standing there helping us to get out of the hole ?', 'So I think the best thing is : do not get into the hole and maintain a sense of self - reliance and personal responsibility because that is best way for us to succeed .', 'Our competition is not getting less worldwide ; it is getting more competitive than ever .', 'We cannot afford to think that we do not have to try hard because the state is there and if something happens , we can always fall back on the government .', 'Cheng hu wu lui ( â \\x80\\x9c the government has moneyâ \\x80\\x9d in Hokkien ) - that is the most disastrous thing you can say and the most harmful to Singaporeans because you are misleading them and it will lead to big trouble .', 'Singapore can only succeed if every one of us works hard , does our best and helps others to make progress together .', 'Then we will prosper and we will have the social safety nets which work for us .', 'Tonight I have talked about these two sets of policies as examples , putting Singaporeans first and enhancing , working together with each other , to show you how we can keep the thrust of our policies but adjust them to deal with specific problems .', 'We will do it with education , with healthcare , with transport , so many other things , not just once - off but progressively because as we go forward , we will encounter new situations , new problems will come and we will have to respond to them and adjust and make new policies .', 'But where the strategic direction is correct , where we are basically sound and we have a temporary problem to deal with , I think we should have the courage and the honesty to say we are doing the right thing , let us tackle this problem , let us not throw out the baby with the bath water , it is very dangerous .', 'After the general election , investors have been watching us very closely .', 'They have asked us directly whether Singapore is changing course fundamentally because our society is changing , our economy is changing , our politics are changing .', 'What new Singapore will it be ?', 'Will we respond to the pressures of the day and become like so many other countries - short term and reactive - or will we maintain our strengths ?', 'As ESM Goh put it yesterday , will our politics remain pragmatic or will we become populist ?', 'That is a very direct question , an important question which they have asked us .', 'EDB just celebrated their 50th anniversary , I went for their events and I met many of the CEOs who came here .', 'I think they came here not just because it was the 50th anniversary but because it was after the general elections and they wanted a sense of how Singapore is , what it is like .', 'They asked me will Singapore change .', 'In other words , has Singaporeâ \\x80\\x99 s political risk gone up ?', 'So I reassured them that we are determined to keep our strengths , that we know what Singaporeâ \\x80\\x99 s prosperity depends on , what our well - being depends on and Singaporeans know what our well being depends on , and we will maintain the policies which are important for us and therefore useful for them .', 'At the dinner for the CEOs at the anniversary , this was my message .', 'They listened carefully to me , I think they took me seriously , they accepted that we had the resolve to do this but I can tell you honestly they are also waiting to see what we will do .', 'If I were them I would also wait to see what Singapore will do .', 'So make sure we do the right thing , so that they continue to invest , we continue to have good jobs and Singapore continues to prosper because that is what our future depends on .', 'Looking ahead , we face more complex challenges but we can create an outstanding future together .', 'What we have today is special , do not take it for granted .', 'It is an extraordinary achievement , the result of hard work by a united population over many years working with good leaders , making Singapore an exceptional country .', 'Whether you go to the developed world for a holiday and come back , whether you go to the neighbouring countries in our region and come back , I think if you are honest , you know when you come back to Singapore , you say I am glad to be home because this is a place where there are very few others like it in the world .', 'People know this

you look away from the policies , away from the details , all the fine print of the schemes and the programmes and so on , I think we have one basic choice which we have to make at this turning point

around the world ?', 'Or are we content for Singapore to be an ordinary country getting by but no different from so many other cities all over Asia ?', 'It is not hard to be ordinary .', 'You can get by but without a hinterland , it will become just like any other city in Asia , then there is no reason for people to be here to invest here , for talent to stay here or even for able Singaporeans in the next generation to want to remain , and then Singaporeans may leave for bigger and better opportunities elsewhere .', 'If we want to continue to be exceptional , then you must make a special effort to look ahead , anticipate problems and opportunities to build for the long term , patiently , resolutely , year by year , whether it is good or bad and to keep our politics pragmatic and constructive so that the political basis is there for us to do work which makes sense for Singapore and for us to work together for a common goal .', 'I believe that to keep Singapore exceptional is a goal well worth striving for .', 'We have shown that we can do it , otherwise we would not be here today and now we have the opportunity to build something which is truly outstanding in Singapore ,

programmes in Singapore to develop our economy , our education and so on over the next five years .', 'I will not go through all these programmes but I would like to share with you just some pictures just to give you a sense of the things which we are doing and why they are worth doing .', 'We are developing new growth industries for example , precision engineering .', 'Companies here used to make TV and radio components , now they produce sophisticated products and this thing which is being made in Singapore is equipment to make semiconductors , so you are not just having semiconductor production lines here where they make wafers and the chips , but you are making the machinery to make the wafers and the chips in Singapore , one level up .', 'You do not put that in any ordinary country .', 'We are developing our infrastructure .', 'You probably have not seen this part of Singapore .', 'It is deep underground , it is the Jurong Rock Cavern because under Jurong Island , there is a big granite formation .', 'We are excavating caverns in the granite formation to provide storage space to support our petrochemical industry .', 'You can store oil , you can store petrochemicals , because you have the storage space , so we can have a petrochemical industry here .', 'Because this is Singapore and the industry is confident to be in Singapore , so a hole in the ground in Singapore is valuable whereas elsewhere you can find holes in the ground for free .', 'Healthcare - we have built the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital .', 'This is a vegetable garden but it is a vegetable garden on the roof of the Khoo Teck Puat hospital , managed by residents in Nee Soon living nearby , volunteering , a community effort .', 'Keep the roof green , keep the patients cheerful and meanwhile they get some vegetables and fruits and flowers , they have even got coconut trees on the rooftop .', 'The next hospital is coming - Ng Teng Fong Hospital in Jurong â \\x80\\x93 in three yearsâ \\x80\\x99 time and thereafter , I hope not too long after that , a new hospital in Sengkang .', 'In education , we have got many things coming on but I think this picture is the most beautiful .', 'It is not a university .', 'That is ITE College West in Chua Chu Kang , opened this year and it looks like a university and what is inside it is even more interesting .', 'They run classes ; they have got cooking classes , culinary classes and this one you see is a French chef and French students .', 'They did not join ITE , they are there because the ITE course is run jointly with the Institut Paul Bocuse in Lyon , France , and here the students and instructor have come from France to spend time in the ITE and they are teaching the students to prepare a three - course meal .', 'The next ITE is ITE Central and I think the buildings will be better .', 'It is in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 and will be opened by 2013 .', 'We are building new townships - this one is already there , Punggol 21 , Treelodge @ Punggol , but many more flats are coming up in Punggol and Punggol New Town when it is done - this is the artistâ \\x80\\x99 s impression of one of the views .', 'So our new towns , our HDB estates will be different and they will not just be HDB estates but they will be in an urban landscape because we are going to have the greenery all around it .', 'In Marina Bay , Gardens by the Bay is almost complete .', 'It will be done by 2012 and if you go inside , you will have lush greenery and it is not just going to be at Marina Bay , we are going to have parks and gardens at the heartlands also .', 'This one is Bishan Park and eventually we will have this in many other parks in Singapore , in the west , the east , in the central area and we will link them all up to create a City in the Garden .', 'So we are building to keep Singapore special and exceptional but even more important than our physical investments is our people - building the sense of ownership and belonging , the instinct to stick together through thick and thin , the drive to surmount every challenge and persevere year after year to make Singapore better .', 'We will be a more diverse society , it will be a challenge but we have got to strengthen the forces that unite us and overcome the forces that pull us apart .', 'We are Singaporeans together on a small island .', 'We are anchored by our emotional links with family and friends and by our shared sense of our history and our common destiny .', 'We are not just here , materialised out of nowhere , appeared out of a Transformers movie maybe .', 'We came here somewhere , sometime there was a history to it and it is crucial to remember where we came from , how we got here .', 'Whether it is Geylang , whether it is Little India , whether it is events which we live through , important milestones - these are the human stories of people , ordinary people who struggled to improve their lives and lived through war or hardship or the turbulent early years of independence , and they achieved extraordinary results with good leadership .', 'They had fulfilling lives and they made Singapore special .', 'Recently , I attended the launch of Singapore HeritageFest and I made a speech about these human stories and emphasised how important they were .', 'It prompted a response in the TODAY newspaper by a lady , Angeline Koh , who is working on digital storytelling and I think I should read a little bit of what she said because it resonated with her .', 'She said , â \\x80\\x9c What are memories and shared experiences but stories .', 'And storytelling is what Singapore as a nation needs .', 'There are unsung heroes in our midst , there are people we meet each day in our homes and in our schools , at work and in play .', 'Our children need to realise they are heroes in the making .', 'They have the power to become heroes by the brave and sacrificial choices they make to live well and for the good of othersâ

lived through , what it meant for them .', 'That is why MICA is launching a Singapore Memory Project to capture , preserve and showcase these memories .', 'They hope to collect five million memories by 2015 because that is our 50th anniversary .', 'The stories can come from anybody , any person , any community , any organisation or institution which has experienced Singapore .', 'Together all these individual stories will weave the tapestry of our nation .', 'They started in July , so far they have collected 30 , 000 plus stories and I have not read all of them but I just picked up two memorable accounts to share with you .', 'One is by a Mr James Seah who lived through the Bukit Ho Swee fire in 1961 .', 'I read what he said and I looked up some footage and some photos of the event and it brings back to life a very traumatic moment for this young man .', 'â \\x80\\x9c There was a dark billowing smoke in the sky , the smell was toxic .', 'People were shouting fire , fire , screaming , shouting .', 'My mother and I ran as fast as we could to flee away from the burnt houses .', 'There was a stampede , the older and weaker people were carried by younger and stronger ones .', 'I noticed my neighbourâ \\x80\\x99 s daughter knelt down on the ground to pray , staring at a darkened sky of smoke .', 'They ended up in Kim Seng School .', 'The school compound was crowded with thousands of fire victims , police , military personnel , doctors , nurses and helpers .', 'Tents were erected for registration of fire victims , cooking utensils to cook on the spot and supply meals

HDB two - room flat at Margaret Drive . â \\x80\\x9d That is one aspect of Singapore and how we got here .', 'Another story , more cheerful , is the memory of Malaysia Cup 1994 - Singapore versus

with you .', 'Mr Muhammad Raydzaâ \\x80\\x99 s comment is worth sharing with you too .', 'He said , â \\x80\\x9c The most memorable moment during the whole Malaysia Cup to me was not the players ,

tensions , threaten global prosperity , especially for smaller countries like Singapore .', 'The trade disputes can also affect the overall relations between the powers .', 'The US and China are jockeying for position and advantage .', 'The US is still stronger , especially militarily , but China is growing in power , influence and confidence .', 'Increasingly , the US has to accommodate China .', 'If there is mutual distrust and rivalry between the two , it is but a small step from a trade disagreement to a wider and more serious quarrel .', 'The US and China are far from going to war with each other , but it is not clear which way their relations will tilt .', 'If they tilt towards more conflict , it will be bad not only for the two powers , but for the rest of the world as

growing our economy , creating new possibilities and expanding our horizons .', 'Individually , it means improving the life of every Singaporean , in a fair , open and cohesive society .', 'Economic Growth One of the top priorities of the Government is therefore to keep the economy growing .', 'We are in a strong position today , because our economy has grown steadily for the past 50 years and

.', 'Individual Singaporeans must see progress in their lives , must feel that their future is bright , and must know that each one of us has our stake in it .', 'This means sharing growth widely and equitably , to improve the lives of all Singaporeans .', 'It also means fully maximising the talents and efforts of our people , and getting the most capable and reliable people into the most consequential jobs , where they can make the most difference , and the greatest contributions .', 'In other words , making sure there is social mobility , so that our meritocracy continues to work .', 'How do we know if our meritocracy is working ?', 'First of all , every child must have a good start in life , regardless of which family you are born into .', 'Secondly , every talent has to be recognised and developed to the fullest .', 'Thirdly , every opportunity has open to anyone with the right attitude and ability .', 'Finally , a capable person must face minimal social impediments to being accepted , to contribute , to be in a position to lead in society .', 'In the long term , this last part â \\x80\\x93 keeping the social impediments down â \\x80\\x93 is the most difficult to sustain .', 'We want Singapore society to maintain an informal and egalitarian tone , where people interact freely and comfortably as equals , and there are no rigid class distinctions or barriers that keep good people down .', 'This is important but it is beyond the Governmentâ \\x80\\x99 s ability to bring about alone .', 'Society itself has to be open and permeable .', 'Each one of us must carry those attitudes , values , norms , that willingness to welcome talent and ability , and to keep the system the way it is .', 'Any society which has been stable for a long time tends to stratify , and it becomes less socially mobile .', 'For example , the UK and India have long entrenched hierarchies and very fixed notions of class , or in India â \\x80\\x93 caste , which they have found very difficult to overcome .', 'Singapore is still a young country of 50 years , and notions of class and hierarchy have not yet calcified .', 'Social cues , markers and norms are still evolving .', 'We do not want them to evolve in the wrong direction and contribute to class divisions and rigidities .', 'Social cues are important because they can become ways to pigeonhole or exclude others , knowingly or unknowingly .', 'In Britain , your accent â \\x80\\x93 the way you speak â \\x80\\x93 can define your status in society .', 'Do you have a posh public school accent ?', 'Do you speak like a professional who has been to Oxbridge ?', 'Do you speak as a working class person , with a local or regional accent ?', 'Do you speak cockney twang ?', 'Then you know you come from a certain part of London and you are a certain class of person , not very high up the totem pole .', 'So George Bernard Shaw wrote , â \\x80\\x9c an Englishmanâ \\x80\\x99 s way of speaking absolutely classifies him .

you give him orders , or do you say â \\x80\\x98 Yes Sirâ \\x80\\x99.', 'He went on to say : â \\x80\\x9c the moment he talks he makes some other Englishman despise him . â \\x80\\x9d And it is true , if you do not have an upper - class accent , you are marked down straightaway .', 'That is why Singapore schools put emphasis on teaching students to speak good English .', 'Otherwise , those children whose parents already speak good English at home will be fine , but others will grow up at a permanent disadvantage .', 'Without everyone being proficient in speaking standard English , Singlish will become a class marker .', 'In other words , if you cannot speak proper English , you are â \\x80\\x9c down thereâ \\x80\\x9d.', 'If you can speak proper English , the doors open for you .', 'This would close the doors on many from less privileged families .', 'There are other social markers that can signal and entrench class differences .', 'Members may recall the recent fuss over an unauthorised secondary school social studies guidebook .', 'It contained a table that had sweeping generalisations about people in Singapore from high and low socio - economic statuses ( SES ).', 'For instance , supposedly , low SES speak Singlish , play soccer or basketball , and eat at hawker centres , while high SES speak formal English , play golf or tennis , and only eat at fine restaurants .', 'The story went viral .', 'Many Singaporeans were appalled and rightly so .', 'Luckily , it was not a guidebook approved by MOE .', 'Lifestyle choices can indeed become separators in society , distinguishing marks .', 'What you eat , how you dress , where you go for holidays , what games you play , what clubs you belong to .', 'In every society , people have ways to show who is in and who is out .', 'You take one look at a person or you listen to him for a moment and you can already place him .', 'There are distinctions in Singapore society too , but the general tone in Singapore is one of restraint .', 'If you wear a chunky gold watch and dress flashily , instead of being impressed , people may think you are a loan shark !', 'That is as it should be .', 'We must discourage people from flaunting their social advantages .', 'We should frown upon those who go for ostentatious displays of wealth and status , or worse , look down on others less well - off and privileged .', 'We should emphasise our commonalities , not accentuate our differences .', 'And so you will see , if you look around the Chamber , everybody informally dressed discussing serious matters of state .', 'In any other Parliamentary Chamber in this part of the world or anywhere in the world , we would all be togged up in our Sunday best just to show that we are somebody in society , but that is not the Singapore way .', 'There is a further obstacle to social mobility : elite groups who become closed circles , preventing outsiders from getting in .', 'Every society has its elite .', 'They occupy the key leadership positions in society â \\x80\\x93 in the Government , in academia , in business , in professions , in politics .', 'Members of the elite share similar backgrounds , interests and social spaces .', 'They may be alumni of the same schools , they may have done business with one another , they may have worked in the same professions .', 'They know one another , they have interacted with one another in different roles over long periods through their lives .', 'Such networks are natural structures in society .', 'They are useful for people to know one another , to get things done informally , to share an implicit understanding of the interests of the society , and to feel a collective sense of responsibility for the society .', 'Such networks are an important part of our social capital .', 'But social networks must always remain open and permeable .', 'They must not close up ; they must not form glass ceilings .', 'It must not be difficult or impossible for others with talent or ability , but lacking the right backgrounds and connections , to be welcomed into the elite group , to rise to the top , to take their rightful place and make their full contribution .', 'If this happened , not only would social mobility be frustrated , but soon the elite group would start to only look after its own interests , and fail in their duty to lead and to care for the rest of society .', 'That would be disastrous for Singapore .', 'Let me share something which Ong Ye Kung told me recently .', 'Raffles Institution ( RI ) is one of our most popular schools .', 'I did not go to RI but I can tell you it is a good school .', 'It has a strong tradition of accepting students from diverse backgrounds , so long as they make the cut .', 'But over the years , RI has become less diverse .', 'The new RI principal has been putting in the effort , speaking to parents of potential students in primary schools across Singapore , to encourage them to apply to RI .', 'To his surprise , some of the parents told him they did not want to send their child there .', 'Why ?', 'Not because they thought their child could not cope with the academic demands but because they feared he would not be able to fit in with other more well - off students .', 'Actually , I think this fear is unfounded because in reality , RI students do come from varied backgrounds .', 'Just over half the students live in public housing , 53 per cent , and all the students get along confidently and comfortably .', 'Bursaries and scholarships are readily available .', 'No parent needs to worry that they cannot afford to send his child to RI , or that his child will feel out of place .', 'But if such a perception exists and discourages promising students from applying to the school , it is not good for RI , it is not good for Singapore .', 'RI knows what it has to do in order to uphold its egalitarian tradition .', 'MOE will work with them and other popular schools too , so that these schools never become self - perpetuating , closed circles .', 'Government policies and programmes must , and do , support social mobility and meritocracy .', 'We make sure that the fundamentals are done well â \\x80\\x93 quality education , home ownership and affordable healthcare , which improve the lives of every Singaporean .', 'We give everyone a good education , and now we are investing heavily in pre - school , to give all Singaporean kids , in fact , almost babies as well , a good start in life .', 'We have a strong social safety net , with targeted assistance schemes , so that those with difficulties are not left behind and forgotten .', 'And we intervene with extra help â \\x80\\x93 whether in education , housing , healthcare or jobs training â \\x80\\x93 for those who need it , to enable them to take full advantage of the opportunities .', 'Above all , our education system must stay open .', 'We have set aside places in primary schools for children without affiliation to these schools and we will do more if necessary .', 'We are expanding opportunities for students from different schools to interact , through sports , community activities , and the Outward Bound Singapore ( OBS ).', 'Last year , I visited the Outward Bound Singapore for their 50th anniversary celebrations .', 'I had attended the course 50 years ago .', 'I chatted with Nicholas Conceicao , who is the Executive Director of OBS .', 'I told him that when I went to OBS 50 years ago as a 15 - year - old , they only took in two students per secondary school .', 'So the group of 130 odd , there were people from 50 , 60 different schools , different language streams , very different social backgrounds .', 'We all had to get together because they mixed us up properly .', 'We went to the course together , we became good friends , and came away understanding the diversity of our society better , and how we could all work together because seventeen days at that impressionable age is an intense experience .', 'You are put through physical stress , you are emotionally put to your limits , you have to work with others , and there is very little that you can do alone and if you do not make friends , you are miserable .', 'You have to make friends across boundaries .', 'So I recounted this and Nicholas told me that today , because of the larger numbers , they cannot take in students from 60 or 70 schools at a time , but they take in students from two to three schools at a time .', 'Nowadays the students all speak English , but still , he finds clear differences in the cultures and interests of the students from the different schools , and even in the way they use language .', 'All speaking in English , but different interest , different vocabulary , really different world perspectives , almost .', 'At OBS , the students still learn to work in teams .', 'So when they pitch a tent , build a raft , or safely belay someone on an obstacle course , they must work closely with teammates ; you canâ \\x80\\x99 t do it alone .', 'So the students learn to bridge their differences , and to trust one another .', 'So after 50 years , OBS remains a valuable opportunity for students to mix and interact across different schools and social groups .', 'And we will do more of this .', 'So we are building an extension of OBS on Coney Island .', 'When that opens , even more students will benefit from this experience .', 'So we are doing many things to improve social mobility , but I have to be honest with you , there are no easy solutions .', 'Many societies have faced this problem .', 'Many ideas have been proposed and tried out .', 'Political philosophers , statesmen , all powerful human minds have been brought to bear , to try to deal with this conundrum of how to keep the society spry , open , stable .', 'There have been no magic bullets .', 'There have been varying degrees of success .', 'The most successful models , perhaps are the Scandinavian countries , but even they have seen widening social inequality in recent times .', 'So , we have to understand that this is what they call a wicked problem .', 'It is a problem with no easy solution , which we will discuss , rightly , repeatedly , in this House , through the years .', 'Our strategy in Singapore has been more successful than most .', 'With universal education , with home ownership , with the Governmentâ \\x80\\x99 s determination to widen opportunities and make the most of every citizen , we have made meritocracy work in Singapore .', 'Now that our society is more settled , we must work harder to keep the pathways open , and to level people up .', 'The Government is not ideological .', 'We are pragmatic .', 'We will try anything which works .', 'We will learn from our own experience , and the experience of others .', 'But we must also be realistic .', 'Spot what looks promising , but please also recognise what will not work .', 'Some people have suggested , I read in the newspapers , a Universal Basic Income , which is a neat idea , so far unproven anywhere in the world .', 'The Finns tried it and aborted the experiment early .', 'It didnâ \\x80\\x99 t work for them .', 'Others want to abolish the PSLE .', 'That is in fact very hard to do .', 'Educators have very different views , and even parents have very different views , whether it is PSLE , you would be better off without the PSLE .', 'But we are taking the first step to change the status quo , by doing away with T - scores .', 'If anyone can come up with a better alternative , certainly , we will certainly consider it .', 'In the end , the Government must focus on practical , effective policies .', 'As a society , we must uphold clear social norms that minimise social barriers and encourage mobility , so as to keep our meritocratic system working well for all Singaporeans .', 'Social Cohesion Meritocracy is about individuals having opportunities and being successful .', 'But we must also be successful together , as one people , one society , and one nation , not just successful alone , but successful together .', 'That is what social cohesion is about .', 'We must feel a sense of social responsibility , and concern for our fellow citizens .', 'Without which , our society cannot hold together .', 'What holds us together is not our pink NRICs , but the shared experiences that we build together over time .', 'We grow up together in national schools , and we are comfortable around each other , regardless of our family backgrounds .', 'We go through National Service , building brotherhood and camaraderie when we march and fight together .', 'We eat at hawker centres , regardless whether we are rich or poor , so the guide book is wrong .', 'We live in HDB estates .', 'We learn the habits and preferences of different races and religions , and we help neighbours out when they are in need .', 'We travel together on public transport .', 'And unlike in some other countries , there is no social stigma to living in public housing , or taking the bus or the train .', 'We celebrate our successes together , such as SG50 recently , and every National Day .', 'And when crises hit , we go through them side by side .', 'We have made much progress in our nation - building .', 'We are now much more cohesive than fifty years ago , when we didnâ \\x80\\x99 t live in integrated HDB estates , townships nor did we do NS together .', 'Or even twenty years ago , before 9 / 11 , and before SARS .', 'But nation - building will always be a work in progress , because the forces that pull Singaporeans in different directions never go away .', 'Race , language and religion are enduring fault lines .', 'From the start , we knew they could divide and destroy us .', 'Today , our social cohesion has grown stronger , but these tidal pulls have grown stronger too .', 'Take from example the influence of China and India on our own ethnic groups on Chinese Singaporeans and Indian Singaporeans .', 'These are two vast nations , even civilizations .', 'They are growing in strength and confidence .', 'It will be a very long time before we become immune to their ethnic , cultural or economic pulls .', 'Furthermore , the relationship is complicated , because on one hand , we want to maintain our separate identity as a multi - racial , sovereign and independent country .', 'But on the other hand , we want to say , we speak Mandarin , we have overseas Indians , we have ethnic links , we have cultural ties , we have an inside track .', 'So between the two , there is tension , and we have to keep that balance , and maintain our position and our cohesion .', 'Likewise , with the Malays .', 'Over time , a Singaporean - Malay identity has emerged clearly .', 'But still , it overlaps with the Malays in Malaysia , both in terms of race as well as religion .', 'And the call for a global ummah ( a community of Muslims around the world ) has a powerful appeal .', 'Furthermore , we are exposed , in this Internet age , to extremist and exclusivist teachings .', 'These can lead individuals astray , and if there is a terrorist attack , it will cause great fear and distrust between Muslims and other Singaporeans .', 'Beyond race , language and religion , we must work at building bridges between different groups in society .', 'Traditionally when we talk about social cohesion , we think of race , language and religion .', 'But if you look at it at other dimensions , there are other gradients , other possible fault lines , other ways where we have to strengthen our social cohesion , and become closer together .', 'One of them is between unions and management .', 'Another one is between old citizens and new .', 'The Labour Movement is one institution vital to our social cohesion .', 'Because of the tripartite partnership , labour management relations are a source of strength for us , unlike in many other countries where unions and managements are bitterly opposed .', 'Whereas in Singapore , labour harmony is secured with the help of a strong NTUC , as we sing at every May Day Rally .', 'But in the new economy , fewer workers are doing jobs traditionally covered by the trade unions .', 'Many more are freelancers and professionals .', 'So if these new groups are left out , and that Union coverage shrinks as a results of the changing workforce composition , and you have more people who are not represented , not taken care of , donâ \\x80\\x99 t feel protected and look for other solutions , it would weaken tripartism and our social compact .', 'So it is better for the Labour Movement to embrace them , to adopt their concerns , to become more inclusive .', 'That is what Chan Chun Sing did in NTUC , widening the Labour Movement membership beyond trade unions , to include NTUC new associates - the PMETs and the freelancers .', 'And now Ng Chee Meng in NTUC will carry on his work .', 'Another bridge we need to build is to our new citizens .', 'Immigrants are part and parcel of our history and our identity .', 'And if you look ahead , we need a steady flow of immigrants , not too many , not too few , just right to top up our population .', 'First generation immigrants into any country will always take time to settle down , to understand the nuances of the culture and character , to progressively integrate into the society .', 'And thatâ \\x80\\x99 s what happened in the past with previous waves of first generation of Singaporeans over the last 200 years and that is a necessary process which has to happen as we continue to have an inflow of people in joining us to become Singapore citizens .', 'The new arrivals have chosen to make Singapore their home , and they will contribute to our country , our society .', 'They have to make every effort to mix and interact with everyone else .', 'On our part , we should welcome them , we should support them in their journey to become Singaporeans , as others have helped our forefathers and help ourselves .', 'Therefore , there is much work to do to maintain our social cohesion .', 'Constructive Politics , Good Leadership Mr Speaker Sir , these are the challenges for the next generation of leaders .', 'To continue to grow Singapore â \\x80\\x93 reinventing our economy , creating new possibilities for the future .', 'To ensure that Singapore is always a land of opportunity , a meritocratic , fair and just society .', 'To hold Singaporeans together in one cohesive society .', 'Can the next generation of leaders build on our shared experiences of 50 years , and maintain the sense of collective mission ?', 'Can they work to improve the lives of all Singaporeans , and not the interests of narrow groups

gaining experience , willing to serve , and most importantly , their hearts are in the right place .', 'We need new leaders for each generation , from each generation .', 'Because each generation has its own challenges to tackle , and tough choices to make .', 'The electorate will be different , the economic landscape will be different , the international order may well also be different .', 'Some hard truths will always remain for Singapore .', 'But even old problems may need new solutions .', 'We must be pragmatic and non - ideological in our approach .', 'Keep an open mind , and make decisions with both the head and the heart .', 'Remember our history but donâ \\x80\\x99 t be trapped by it .', 'And that is why leadership renewal is crucial : new ideas , new bonds and new connections are needed with every new generation .', 'Last week , at the reopening of Parliament , I had a chance to chat with Mr Low Thia Khiang .', 'Someone took a picture of us and The Workersâ

role in our political system , whoever is their party leader .', 'Opposition parties keep Singapore politics contestable .', 'In other words , the ruling party , the PAP does not have a monopoly of power , does not have the right to rule Singapore indefinitely .', 'So long as the PAP government performs , it keeps the votersâ \\x80\\x99 support , it stays in power and the opposition cannot gain ground .', 'But if the PAP government becomes incompetent or corrupt , then of course the opposition will grow .', 'So our system gives the PAP government , gives every government the incentive to perform , and to keep the opposition performing its role where it is , namely , in the opposition .', 'The PAP is determined to perform .', 'We treat every election as a serious contest .', 'We take every debate in the House seriously .', 'And that is why we amended the Constitution to ensure that there will always be at least 12 Opposition and NCMPs in the House , whatever the outcome of the General Election .', 'Political parties do not have a fixed lifespan â \\x80\\x93 a time to live and a time to die , as Ecclesiastes puts it .', 'How long a political party continues in government â

\\x80\\x93 you can also to choose to join CareShield Life .', 'It is not compulsory , but you can join and I hope you will do so .', 'Why ?', 'Because you will get a generous subsidy to help pay the premiums .', 'The Government will co - pay , so you are getting a good deal .', 'But really because it will give you and your family more peace of mind .', 'It is something which you probably will need .', 'Gan Kim Yong tells me that this is the most difficult of his healthcare schemes to explain to the public .', 'So he commissioned me to do it for him tonight .', 'Young , healthy people cannot imagine themselves being old and disabled .', 'When you are young , sometimes it feels like you will be young forever , but alas it is not so .', 'If you wait until you are older before

to retire in First World Singapore .', 'Understandably , they were worried about their healthcare needs .', 'We implemented the PGP to recognise the Pioneer Generation for their sacrifices and to

times .', 'Having worked for some years already , they had saved enough in their CPF for the down payment .', 'Now their monthly CPF contributions are enough to pay their instalments .', 'So they have

would be theirs that they would defend , if necessary , with their lives .', 'As a result , generations of Singaporeans have been uplifted by home ownership .', 'Take for example , a first generation resident in Ang Mo Kio .', 'His four room flat would now be about 40 years old , and can fetch more than $ 400 , 000 in the resale market .', 'In a good location , probably more .', 'When he bought the flat 40 years ago , how much do you think he paid for it ?', '$ 25 , 000 .', 'Even accounting for inflation , this is a huge appreciation .', 'This is how we have enabled many Singaporeans to have a substantial asset to your name , even lower income households .', 'In fact , if you take our homeowners who are 90 per cent of the population , and you look at the poorest one - fifth of homeowners , each have on average $ 200 , 000 of wealth in his or her HDB flat .', '$ 200 , 000 of wealth .', 'That means you take the value of the flat , you subtract off his mortgage unpaid and he still has $ 200 , 000 to his name .', 'This does not happen anywhere else .', 'Young couples buying a flat today probably would not see such a huge appreciation as the Ang Mo Kio resident who bought the flat 40 years ago , because our economy is maturing and it cannot grow as fast anymore .', 'But you still get a good headstart because the Government helps you out with a subsidised flat or housing grants , and often both .', 'And as long as our economy grows , the value of the flat will go up for many years , just not as dramatically', 'Why 99 years ?', 'The oldest flats in Ang Mo Kio are about 40 years old .', 'Sometimes residents ask what will happen to their flats as time passes and their leases run down .', 'Will their flats still hold value ?', 'What options do they have ?', 'Why are their leases for 99 years ?', 'Can they be longer ?', 'Actually , 99 years is a very long time .', 'Letâ \\x80\\x99 s say you buy a new flat from HDB in your early 30s .', 'At the end of 99 years , you will be 130 + years old â \\x80\\x93 and probably would not need this flat anymore .', 'If you have children , they will also be very old , almost as old as the flat itself in their 80s or 90s .', 'And if you have grandchildren , your grandchildren will already be grandparents .', 'So , 99 years is a very long time .', 'In particular , when you retire , after living in your flat for 30 or 40 years , it will still have a good 60 + years of lease left .', 'That is long enough for it to retain substantial value , and be a good retirement nest egg as you can see with the Ang Mo Kio example I gave you just now .', 'You can continue living in the flat , rent out a room for income if needed , and one day , pass on the flat down to your children .', 'Or you can right - size , sell it and move to a smaller unit .', 'Or you can go for Lease Buyback and return the remaining lease to HDB , then use the money you get back for retirement .', 'I explained how all this works in a previous National Day Rally , 2014 .', 'If you look up the clips on the YouTube , you will still find them there .', 'But we can make things better .', 'We can do several things to help residents monetise their older flats .', 'We can expand the Lease Buyback scheme .', 'We can do things to improve the liquidity of the resale market .', 'That means to make it easier for people to buy and sell old flats , and MND is working on this .', 'What if you had bought a resale flat instead ?', 'Well , our oldest flats are at most 52 years old , so you have at least another 47 years left of your lease , which is still a long time .', 'Very few of todayâ \\x80\\x99 s HDB owners will outlive their leases .', 'HDB estimates that it will happen to less than 2 per cent of households , including those who have bought resale flats .', 'So it is not likely to happen to you .', 'It could happen , but not likely .', 'It could happen to your children if they inherit your flat .', 'But this should not be a problem if your children buy their own BTO flat , with its own 99 - year lease , as many do .', 'Because then an inheritance for them would be a gift and a bonus .', 'And even if you have to return your old flat at the end of its lease , do not worry because the Government will help you get another flat to live in .', 'It may be a BTO flat from HDB with a fresh 99 - year lease , if you are eligible for another one .', 'It may be a resale flat on a shorter and cheaper lease .', 'Or it may be a 2R Flexi flat for retirement .', 'There are different options , depending on your needs and what you can afford .', 'But whichever option you choose , you will have to pay for the lease .', 'This is only fair , because you bought the original flat knowing when the lease would run out , and knowing that the flat would then have to be returned to HDB .', 'There is one fundamental reason why HDB leases are for 99 years and that is , we need to be fair to future generations .', 'Let me explain .', 'HDB sells the flat to you for 99 years .', 'You own it , and you can pass it on for one or two generations .', 'After that , the flat returns to the state , the Government redevelops the land , and builds new flats for future generations .', 'This is the only way to recycle the land and ensure that all our descendants can buy new BTO flats of their own .', 'If instead the Government had sold you the flat on freehold , that means in perpetuity .', 'Sooner or later we would run out of land to build new flats for future generations .', 'The owners would pass their flats down to some of their descendants , many generations into the future .', 'Those lucky enough to have a flat , they become flat owner .', 'Those not lucky enough to inherit a property would get nothing .', 'So our society would split into property owners and those who cannot afford a property .', 'I think that would be most unequal , and socially divisive .', 'So , that is why 99 year leases are not just for HDB flats .', 'In fact , for private housing also , the Government only sells land on 99 year leases .', 'There is also a practical reason why we cannot extend the leases easily .', 'If you look at older buildings today , some look rather worn down , even before they are 50 years old .', 'Some condominiums are like that , private property .', 'After a century , I am sure the mechanical and electrical systems will be obsolete .', 'The concrete will have deteriorated in our tropical climate .', 'And even if we could fix all that , the recurrent maintenance costs would be very high .', 'So it is better to let the leases expire , take the blocks back , demolish them and rebuild afresh .', 'We may keep a few blocks which have historical or heritage value , or sentimental reason , or to remind people what the old days were like , but these should be the exception .', 'For the others , we can rebuild newer , better , more liveable flats , blocks , and townships , more suited to what our grandchildren and great - grandchildren will want to live in .', 'Today if I offer you to live in a 100 - year old flat , I do not think there will be many takers because you want the mod cons .', 'You want the lifts .', 'You want the power supply .', 'You want the modern sanitation .', 'You want the convenience .', 'You want the finishes , the styles .', 'You want to be up to date .', 'I think our grandchildren will also want to be up to date .', 'It is better we take back .', 'We rebuild .', 'Singapore progresses while keeping an essence of its history and soul .', 'That is why when the leases expire , the flats will have to return to the state .', 'HIP Expansion', 'There are still many decades before the first HDB leases expire .', 'As the flats grow older , the Government will help you to keep them in good condition .', 'We do this through HDBâ \\x80\\x99 s upgrading programmes .', 'We started with the Main Upgrading Programme ( MUP ) in the 1990s .', 'This one happens to be in my own constituency and you can see each one of these red bars is one lift tower .', 'This is one block , this is one block .', 'Itâ \\x80\\x99 s a block with seven lift towers at government expense , upgraded MUP and LUP together .', 'Later , we replaced the MUP with the the Home Improvement Programme ( HIP ).', 'The HIP has been very popular .', 'It is an essential upgrade .', 'We fix up maintenance problems , like spalling concrete , ceiling leaks , and damaged pipes .', 'This is the new toilet after it has been upgraded .', 'We upgrade the electrical supply too .', 'This is a substation .', 'Because more families have air - conditioners , washing machines , computers , and now personal mobility devices ( PMDs ), needing to be charged .', 'The HIP scheme is heavily subsidised .', 'The Government pays up to 95 per cent , so residents pay as little as a few hundred dollars for the upgrading .', 'Not surprising that after upgrading , the flat value usually goes up .', 'We launched the HIP 10 years ago .', 'The final batch of HIP flats will be announced by next year .', 'So within a few years , all flats eligible for HIP will have been balloted .', 'Hopefully , passed , executed and upgraded .', 'That means altogether 450 , 000 flats upgraded under MUP plus HIP .', 'Now , HIP covers flats built up to 1986 .', 'We launched the programme a decade ago .', 'So the flats which missed qualifying for HIP are also now starting to show their age .', 'I know many HDB residents in these younger flats are also hoping for an upgrading .', 'In estates like Yishun , Tampines and Jurong , there are flats built both before and after the 1986 cut - off .', 'So people ask , why next door got HIP , my flat got no HIP .', 'And then there is Pasir Ris , where residents started collecting keys in 1987 .', 'So , DPM Teo Chee Hean used to remind the Ministers regularly that Pasir Ris has not had any HIP projects .', 'And I would console him regularly that Pasir Ris flats do not need any HIP yet , they donâ \\x80\\x99 t need HIP yet , you are new , very good .', 'But still he said , my residents are waiting anxiously .', 'Now that the oldest Pasir Ris flats are 30 years old , they are no longer quite so new .', 'Wear and tear is starting to show , so I am very happy to announce that we will expand the HIP and HIP will now include blocks built up to 1997 .', 'That means another 230 , 000 flats will benefit .', 'So Pasir Ris will get HIP , the older flats .', 'And so will Yishun , Tampines , Jurong and a number of other estates .', 'New HIP II', 'Beyond HIP , what more can we do as our flats grow older ?', 'The expanded HIP will include flats built up to 1997 .', 'In other words , the flats will get HIP about 30 years after they were built .', 'After upgrading , these flats should be good for another 30 to 40 years .', 'By that time , the flats will be 60 to 70 years old , and I expect they will be showing their age again .', 'We are determined not to let our public housing degenerate into ragged , squalid slums , which has happened in many other cities .', 'So we should do a second round of upgrading , at about the 60 to 70 - year mark .', 'Let us call this HIP II .', '60 to 70 years old .', 'HIP II will keep the flats safe and liveable , and also help them retain their value as their leases run down .', 'It should see the flats through to the end of their leases .', 'So in short , every HDB flat can expect to be upgraded twice during their lease .', 'Once when they are about 30 years old , through the MUP or HIP , and a second time through HIP II , when they are about 60 - 70 years old .', 'The first flats will reach 60 - 70 years old about 10 years from now .', 'So that is when we plan to launch the HIP II programme .', 'Akan datang .', 'HIP II is a huge financial commitment for the Government .', 'If you own a private property , you are fully responsible for its upkeep and upgrading .', 'But because HDB is public housing , the Government will upgrade each HDB flat not once , but twice during its lifespan .', 'Furthermore , the Government will help you pay most of the upgrading cost .', 'The first HIP will cost the Government more than $ 4 billion .', 'HIP II will probably cost even more , because the flats will be twice as old by then .', 'But it is well justified , and we will do it so long as MOF has the money .', 'SERS', 'I know what some of you are thinking .', 'HIP and HIP II are fine if I want to stay on in my flat .', 'But what if I want to move out ?', 'Can I get SERS â \\x80\\x93 the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme ?', 'SERS is a very good scheme for estate rejuvenation .', 'It brings new residents into the estate , often young families , who inject vitality into the community .', 'I have two SERS projects in Teck Ghee , and recently I visited Teck Ghee Parkview .', 'It replaced the BTO blocks which came into the SERS site .', 'The new flats have made a noticeable difference to Teck Ghee â \\x80\\x93 the estate is livelier , more children are running around , more young couples like this one whom I visited .', 'It has cheered up the neighbourhood .', 'Now we have more babies in Teck Ghee , some even able to dance with their mothers .', 'So yes , SERS is indeed one option , if your flat happens to be SERS - ed and selected .', 'But SERS is a very limited scheme .', 'It is meant for selected HDB blocks or precincts , which have high development value which we can unlock .', 'What does that mean ?', 'Take Tanglin Halt for example .', 'It is in Queenstown .', 'It is our first HDB township .', 'It was not built optimally .', 'The precincts were not always well laid out .', 'There are low rise flats , the flats have layouts where there are large surface car parks , empty spaces , odd leftover spaces .', 'So if you take it all back and redevelop it completely , Tanglin Halt is being SERS - ed , you can use the space better , you can create denser housing , greener environments .', 'So from something like this , you can go to something like this , 40 yearsâ \\x80\\x99 change or 50 years change .', 'We are redeveloping Tanglin Halt through SERS , using the space better , and creating denser housing and greener environments .', 'It makes economic sense in such cases for the Government to take back the flats early and redevelop the site .', 'Because there is a lot of value unlocked , we share this value with residents through generous compensation .', 'And with generous compensation , we can make the acquisition compulsory .', 'In other words , HDB decides on SERS , and residents do not get to vote', 'However , HDB estimates that only around 5 % of flats are suitable for SERS .', 'There will be a few more SERS projects to come , but many projects with high redevelopment potential have already been done .', 'Because HDB chose the promising ones and did them first .', 'VERS', 'So what about the flats that do not get SERS ?', 'Well , HDB has been studying this intensively , and I have good news to share tonight .', 'More households will be able to benefit from redevelopment before their leases expire .', 'Why ?', 'Because the Government has good reason to take back more flats , and redevelop them as they grow older , before 99 years are up .', 'Let me explain .', 'When HDB towns grow older , and the leases in the estates are nearing expiry , we have to redevelop the towns .', 'We want to do this in an orderly way .', 'In the early years , because of the housing shortage , HDB often built in a tremendous rush .', 'Several older estates were built within short periods , especially in the 1970s and 1980s .', 'Marine Parade between 1974 - 1976 â \\x80\\x93 within three years .', 'Ang Mo Kio and Bedok , after that , 1975 - 1981 â \\x80\\x93 within six to seven years .', 'This one is Marine Parade .', 'Therefore , if we do not plan ahead , 99 years later , all the leases in such towns will expire around the same time , and all the flats will be returned to the state within a few years .', 'We will have to find new homes for a lot of people at once .', 'HDB will have to tear down and rebuild the old flats in a hurry , just like when we first built Marine Parade , Ang Mo Kio and Bedok .', 'I do not think that is a good idea .', 'The towns will become construction sites all over again , with cranes all over the place .', 'I think we should redevelop our old towns over 20 to 30 years , rather than within four to five years , progressively .', 'That means starting when the oldest flats reach about 70 years old onwards .', 'So some flats , you redevelop when you get to 70 years old , some 75 , some 80 and you stretch it out over 20 , 30 years and progressively do things in a measured and considered way .', 'Then , just like with SERS , the estate and the community can be renewed progressively .', 'There will be more new and younger residents moving in and the estate will become more vibrant .', 'Those moving out will have somewhere to go to , and those staying will have rejuvenation to look forward to .', 'This is why it makes sense for the Government to take back flats progressively over several decades , starting from about 70 years onwards , and stage out the redevelopment .', 'We will need a new scheme for this .', 'Of course , we will compensate the residents whose flats are taken back early .', 'We will also help them get another flat to live in , just like we would if their leases had run out .', 'But the terms will be less generous than SERS , because there will less financial upside .', 'There is social merit in it .', 'There is community merit in it but there is not so much financial upside .', 'Therefore , the scheme will be voluntary .', 'I will call it VERS â \\x80\\x93 Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme .', 'So if you donâ \\x80\\x99 t get SERS - ed , you can hope to be VERS - ed .', 'Residents in the precinct will have to vote for VERS , just like for HIP .', 'If the residents vote yes , we will proceed .', 'The Government will buy back the whole precinct , all the flats and redevelop , and residents can use their proceeds to help pay for another flat .', 'If the residents vote no , then they can continue to live in their flats until their leases run out .', 'This is a long term plan .', 'We will not start doing VERS for another 20 years .', 'We need time to work out how to select the precincts , how to pace the redevelopments out , the specific terms of the Governmentâ \\x80\\x99 s offer and so on .', 'We also need to study how to afford VERS for the long term .', 'But I think such a scheme is necessary , so we will start planning for VERS now .', 'Recap', 'I have covered quite a bit of ground on housing .', 'So let me do a quick recap .', 'There is an examination later .', 'First , we will expand HIP to upgrade 230 , 000 additional flats built between 1987 and 1997 .', 'This will happen when the flats are about 30 years old , and this will start soon .', 'Second , we will do HIP II to upgrade flats a second time .', 'This is a big project .', 'This will happen when the flats reach 60 - 70 years old .', 'HIP II will start in about 10 yearsâ \\x80\\x99 time .', 'Third , we will have VERS to progressively redevelop precincts in ageing housing estates .', 'This will happen from about the 70th year onwards .', 'VERS will start 20 years from now .', 'Rebuilding Singapore', 'Eleven years ago , at NDR 2007 , I showed a CGI fly - through of what we hoped Punggol would look like one day .', 'Some of you may remember watching it .', 'At that time , Punggol 21 Plus was still just a gleam in the eyes of our HDB planners .', 'Recently , Lawrence Wong showed me a new fly - through of Punggol , this time using a drone

better life for all ?', 'As the Presidentâ \\x80\\x99 s Address puts it , we want every Singaporean worker to hold a skilled , well - paid job ; every family to live in an affordable , comfortable

everyone has a say , a stake and a sense of belonging .', 'And it is one where everyone aspires to do better through their own efforts and feels that he or she has a real chance to move up .', 'Why is this important ?', 'Firstly , and most fundamentally , because we are one family , one Singapore family .', 'Secondly , it is a reflection of what we are : our values , what we stand for .', 'When we look at the mirror in the morning , how we see ourselves , how we want others to see us .', 'And thirdly , it is also a practical matter , because if we are inclusive , if we work together , we stand together and succeed .', 'But if not , we fall apart and we fail .', '5 .', 'Our society is changing .', 'New challenges to creating an inclusive society have emerged .', 'There are more different groups , each with sharper , different interests and concerns â \\x80\\x93 the young , the old , the special interest groups , different socio - economic groups , the professionals , the middle class

ago , I was preparing for a National Day Rally speech talking about aging and I made a special effort to visit Radin Mas , Mr Sam Tanâ \\x80\\x99 s ground , because Radin Mas residents were at a more

respond to this .', '9 .', 'After the General Election , I asked DPM Tharman to review social policies comprehensively .', 'Set up a committee , oversee a comprehensive whole - of - government

, for it to come before the national consciousness as a priority which we have to deal with .', 'So the ministries of Manpower , Education , National Development , Health , MCYS itself , even Home Affairs are involved , because if you are talking about kids with problems , MHA has a vested interest .', 'And we have been meeting , discussing , tossing up ideas , getting a grip on the problem and

Education , on the continued education and training which MOM is overseeing .', 'And that is one of the reasons why we have put a very strong team into the Ministry of Education .', 'When Ng Eng Hen moved to Mindef , I thought carefully and decided to put Heng Swee Keat into MOE , who has been there before , who understands education and has experience in the Government at very senior levels and would be able to get going , hit the ground running .', 'And I supported him with a strong team - Mr Lawrence Wong , Mr Hawazi Daipi , Ms Sim Ann , so that education is right up there on the front burner .', 'And education , not just doing well at what we have already done , but taking new initiatives , moving into new areas and starting early in life so that children can get ahead and do better than their parents .', 'So we are focusing on good quality , affordable pre - school education â \\x80\\x93 how to support that , how to make sure that all Singaporeans can get there .', 'We are making sure that every neighbourhood school is a good school .', 'It is not a slogan .', 'It is a reality and we make sure that every neighbourhood school is a good school and any MP who feels that his school is not quite up there , please let us know and we will do something about it .', '12 .', 'We are putting in learning support programmes at Primary One and Primary Two , because when the kids start with a deficit , we want to close that deficit .', 'We do not want the gaps to widen and have them falling further and further behind .', 'And we are helping children with special needs , specialised learning and therapy , expanded capacity and higher quality in their special education schools .', 'I think that it is the right thing to do .', 'I heard Ms Denise Phua speaking on Tuesday with great passion .', 'I agree with her , we need to do more .', 'I do not agree with her that it should all come onto the Governmentâ \\x80\\x99 s plate .', 'But we will do more and with people like her , I think we will achieve more .', 'Ms Low Yen Ling also spoke about this and how there are children in pre - primary or pre - school who have learning difficulties and need to be diagnosed and identified and helped early .', 'And these are all very sensible , very practical approaches which we will pursue and pursue aggressively .', '13 .', 'Even then , some kids will get into trouble .', 'It is in the nature of kids , especially boys , and we have to tackle these youth problems early because we want to nip the problem in the bud before they get into their first dip , first brush with the law or second brush with the law .', 'Once they are exposed to hardcore drugs or criminals , then they are on a lifetime of crime , wasted .', 'And that again is multi - ministry , because it cannot just be done by good intentions in MCYS .', 'So we must get people to move .', 'We must start early in life and we must keep the avenues open for people to move up .', 'If you are talented , you are hardworking , if you have drive and determination , however poor your background , there must be no financial or social impediment for you to move .', 'And I think we can say that institutionally , we have that .', 'Schools , bursaries , fee remissions , universities â \\x80\\x93 if you are able , you are willing to study and you show the performance , the door is open .', '14 .', 'We are widening access to higher education ; particularly university places , where we have 25 per cent , going on to 30 , of each cohort in state universities .', 'We have Mr Lawrence Wong with a committee studying how we can widen access further , in one form or another , so that more students can make it to tertiary education .', 'More bursaries and scholarships will be given , and beyond the university , better places , better facilities in the polytechnics and the ITEs , at every level , to let students move up and achieve their best .', '15 .', 'The principle is meritocracy .', 'The most capable , the most reliable , the one with the most potential to go into the most crucial job .', 'Because we want to put the person who is going to do it best so that the rest of us can be assured that nothing will go wrong .', 'But we have to see meritocracy widely .', 'Not as a narrow , one - dimensional definition of success as being examinations and results , but a broader range of abilities , many models of achievement , many ways to make your mark .', 'Whether it is the arts , whether it is sports , whether it is science , whether it is as a businessman , an entrepreneur or in the public sector , whether as a leader or a specialist .', 'There are many ways to do well and society should recognise and celebrate all the different people who do well .', '16 .', 'We also have to set the tone for our society if we want to keep our system open .', 'Because the rules may be there , the scholarships may be there but if there is a social gap between the lower end and the higher end , if you are not accepted , you do not feel comfortable , you are awkward or a magic circle forms and you cannot get into the magic circle , I think that is very damaging .', 'So we must keep our society open , egalitarian , informal .', 'People socialising together , mixing freely together , getting to know one another , integrating into one Singapore team â \\x80\\x93 in our state schools , during National Service , in life , in our hawker centres .', '17 .', 'We have done this so far ; there are many examples of students who have come up from poor homes who have excelled .', 'We have kids who took part in theatre for the first time , discovered an aptitude , talent - spotted , and who are going into SOTA next year .', 'We have a badminton player who developed his academic and athletic potential in the Sports School and will be representing Singapore in the upcoming SEA Games .', 'We have got budding talent in the NUS Maths and Science School excelling in Mathematics or Biomedical Olympiads , flying the flag for Singapore .', 'We have a son of a taxi driver winning an SAF scholarship to study in Imperial College in London .', 'There are many more of such stories and we must make sure that every time there is a young boy or girl with the potential who was from a poor home , we identify him and we smoothen the path for him and we help him to make it .', '18 .', 'So the first approach towards dealing with our social problems is to strengthen the ability for people to succeed .', 'But the second approach , which must complement the first one , is to strengthen our social safety nets because there is a yin and a yang .', 'The yang is what you try to do for yourself , to compete , to achieve , to thrust forward .', 'With the yin , you are looking out for one another , giving your peer a helping hand , helping the person who cannot quite make it , come along and help to take the next step .', 'We have been doing more of this , especially for the low income and disadvantaged families .', 'In the last five years , we created Workfare and ComCare .', 'During the economic crisis , we implemented the Jobs Credit scheme aimed mainly at the lower end .', 'And with Workfare , the Government is providing significant wage top - ups .', 'Every year , 400 , 000 workers benefit .', 'Every year , they receive more than S $ 400 million all in .', 'It means about S $ 1 , 000 per worker .', 'S $ 400 million of benefits to the lower end - it goes into their Medisave , their CPF , to them in cash payments .', 'A very substantial measure .', 'Not a minimum wage , but better than a minimum wage and something which we will enhance as we gain experience , as we understand how it works , as we see where we need to do more .', 'This is just as how we are enhancing ComCare , as Mdm Halimah informed members a couple of days ago .', '19 .', 'We also want to encourage employers to help low - end workers to upgrade to be able to earn more .', 'And that means what NTUCâ \\x80\\x99 s Mr Lim Swee Say calls â \\x80\\x9c best - sourcingâ \\x80\\x9d.', 'It is jargon .', 'It means that when you outsource and you award a contract to a firm to do work â \\x80\\x93 cleaning or maintenance or security â \\x80\\x93 you want a firm who will have workers who are properly trained , properly equipped , properly paid .', 'And not just a firm which will give you the lowest tender and then , having made the lowest tender , offer the lowest possible wage to the workers and do as little as he can without getting into trouble on the contract .', '20 .', 'This is something which the unions are very focused on .', 'Mr Zainal Sapari spoke at length on this a couple of days ago and the Government supports this .', 'And I think the Government itself , as an employer , has to see how we would do this .', 'I think we have a problem with the lower - end workers because in the old days , the lower - end workers were unionised .', 'We had daily - rated employees , they worked for the PUB , they worked for the Government , Environment Ministry but progressively , this unionised generation is not there anymore .', 'The daily - rated employees are not there anymore .', 'And the low - end workers today , the â \\x80\\x98 sua gangâ \\x80\\x99 ( Hokkien for odd job labourers ), the people who are the cleaners , they are not unionised .', 'So there is nobody to speak for them , there is nobody to fight for their rights , nobody to argue , advocate on their behalf .', 'It is not easy to organise them but I think it is a problem we have which we have to find some way to solve .', 'We owe it to these low - end workers to make sure that they too can earn a decent living in Singapore .', '21 .', 'Our focus is on the low - end but we will extend the support beyond the low - end , selectively where it is deserved and justified , also to the not - so - poor .', 'The lower - middle income , the middle income workers , people who are not so poor that they need help every month , but from time to time run into difficulty and then they need some assistance to tide over that period .', 'And that is why we are paying attention to long - term care for chronic sick and elderly , because I think many of the families in the middle have elderly parents .', 'If they are working and their parents are well , that is fine .', 'But if they are working and their parents get ill , that can be quite a burden .', 'And if the illness is catastrophic , for instance if they have cancer , that is even more difficult , drugs are expensive and it can carry on for many years .', 'So these are problems we have and which we are focusing on , and I think we understand that in an environment where incomes are stretching out , where the middle - income are sometimes having to struggle to make ends meet , some helping hand will be necessary .', '22 .', 'The most important thing we do for Singaporeans of course is to help every family own a home , a HDB flat .', 'Mr Khaw Boon Wan spoke at length about it yesterday and I am sure that will not be his last speech in this House on this subject .', 'I would just like to add a few words that the house is much more than a secure roof over their heads .', 'The house , in Singapore , is also a major way for us to level up the less successful and to give them a valuable asset and a retirement nest egg .', 'We are using the HDB flat as a means to give every Singaporean household a stake .', 'This ( the house ) belongs to me , this is what I am going to work for and help pay for , this is what I am proud of , this is what I will defend and this is what I really should keep until retirement .', 'So that is why we are making sure that HDB flats are affordable , even to lower - income households .', 'If you earn S $ 2 , 000 , you can buy a flat .', 'If you earn more than S $ 1 , 500 , it may be a bit harder but we will help you to do that .', 'Already , we are giving the poorer households more support when they buy flats .', 'The new MPs who may not have heard of such jargon , should know that there are additional housing grants if your income is not so high and if your income is quite low , there are special housing grants on top of the additional housing grant .', 'And maybe one day , we will have an extra special housing grant .', 'But the purpose of this is to target the subsidies , the assistance , the Government support , so that I give the lower - end an extra helping hand up .', 'Here , this ( the house ) is yours , please take good care of it .', 'We do have a problem because a minority is not always taking good care of it .', 'Some of them , having bought a flat , are getting into debt .', 'Their flat is protected .', 'In fact , the creditor cannot foreclose and take a flat away from you .', 'But a creditor can put enough pressure on you that you feel that you have no choice but to sell the flat and clear your debts and go and see your MP and ask for another one .', 'That is a very serious problem and that is one of the important reasons why we have a long queue for rental flats .', 'Not because they did not have a house in the first place , but because they lost the house which was theirs , the money is gone and now they are homeless and it has become the Governmentâ \\x80\\x99 s problem again .', 'And we must find some way to address this problem .', 'It is not easy but to be honest , I think we have to acknowledge that there is a difficulty here which has to be tackled .', '23 .', 'The third aspect of making an inclusive society is to enable Singaporeans to age with dignity and grace .', 'We are going to have a silver tsunami coming and we need a national effort to plan ahead to be ready for it so that it does not wash us away .', 'We need elderly people to be able to work longer , to help them to work longer , to help employers to keep them at work productively .', 'And I think if you look at the numbers , the proportion of elderly Singaporeans who are working longer is going up and will continue to go up .', 'But most importantly , I think mindsets are changing .', 'People are beginning to understand that it is good to work and employers are beginning to understand that older workers have their advantages .', 'They are steadier , they may not be quite so strong and resilient , but they are reliable and if you can keep them for a long time , they can be productive for a very long time .', '24 .', 'To prepare for the silver tsunami , we need to contain and share healthcare costs .', 'This , also , the Ministry of Health is doing .', 'Mr Gan Kim Yong has been focusing on that .', 'We need to build up care services so that there will be more hospitals , many more nursing homes but , beyond hospitals and nursing homes , also community facilities and home care .', 'Because for old folks , if you can stay at home , it is always much better than if you have to go to a nursing home or have to be at a hospital , because you want the elderly to enjoy their care and the love of the family and to be near friends and the community .', '25 .', 'So these are major national initiatives which will be necessary over the next 10 years .', 'I say national because it cannot be done just by the Government .', 'You will need VWOs , you need community groups , you need households , parents , families all to participate and do their part .', 'We can help to orchestrate this but it is something which has to be a national effort .', '26 .', 'All these measures are essential if we are going to help the lower - income Singaporeans earn more , if we are going to enable more of their children to do well , if we are going to prepare for an aging society .', 'The trends themselves will be hard to reverse but what we do will make a major difference and will help to ensure that nobody is left behind .', '27 .', 'Social spending by the State will grow .', 'As Ms Indranee reminded us , these programmes all cost money and some of this money will have to come from the State and the Government is prepared for this .', 'We made major revisions to our revenue streams in the last term of this Government and I think we will be okay for this term of the Government .', 'But it is not just having enough money , you must have programmes which are properly designed and must yield results .', 'I wanted to say the programmes need to be cost - effective .', 'I was told that the phrase â \\x80\\x9c cost - effectiveâ \\x80\\x9d shows inadequate warmth but the programmes have to be effective .', 'We have to worry about the cost , the programmes have to work and at the very least , they must not make things worse .', 'And in social spending , it is quite possible for more money to make things worse .', 'If you look at the way families have completely broken down in the West , it has a lot to do with the way the welfare state was implemented and the money which was spent supporting single mothers .', 'So we must make sure that we spend the money well and the money goes to effective projects and they really are investments in our people .', 'We would like to think so , we would like to try our best to make it so .', 'But if you look at the US healthcare system , if you look at the problems which the Europeans have with their welfare state â \\x80\\x93 the Greeks are the worst , but so too many other European countries â \\x80\\x93 you know that more spending is not always better and just calling it an investment does not mean it is going to yield you a positive return .', '28 .', 'So , we have to make sure that somebody is keeping our system straight and sustainable .', 'The next five years , I am quite confident we have adequate resources , we can do what is necessary .', 'Beyond that , it will depend on how much our needs and our programmes go .', 'But I can tell you that if we do all the things which have been mooted over the last few days in this chamber , we will not have to wait five years before you think about raising taxes .', 'We would have to think now where the money is going to come from and so I think we move , but have a care and make sure that we get results .', '29 .', 'By building an inclusive society , we will strengthen our social compact and we will build a Singapore where we care for one another ; where we can treat one another with grace , with

Improves All Lives', '30 .', 'Social cohesion and intangible aspirations are important .', 'But so too is a vibrant economy .', 'We need a vibrant economy if you are going to create jobs , if you are going to raise wages , if you are going to generate confidence in a brighter future .', 'Because if the economy is slow , if nothing is happening , it is very hard to be optimistic , to find new opportunities and to have a zest for tomorrow .', 'You look at Japan â \\x80\\x93 high level of income , high technology , very disciplined , very well - educated people .', 'What is missing ?', 'A certain zest because their optimism is not there that they can grow , that tomorrow would be better and it is an exciting journey we are on .', 'And I think that is why growth is important to us .', 'Without growth , as many members have pointed out , including Ms Amy Khor , the poor will be the worst hit .', 'So when members say , well , we have over - emphasised growth , I would say have a care .', 'Focus on social issues ; I have spent a lot of time talking about them .', 'Focus on intangibles , focus on emotional connection , but do not forget that we need to feed our people and we need to grow our economy .', '31 .', 'We aim for high - quality and inclusive growth .', 'But we must also recognise that competition is fiercer than ever .', 'Every year , the Chinese produce seven million graduates .', 'Indians produce another three .', 'That is 10 million , equal to two Singapores .', 'They are going to have an impact in the world , not just at the lower - end and blue - collar professions , but middle - income white - collar professionals everywhere in the world .', 'It is a tide and we have to ride it .', '32 .', 'Competition is threatening entire industries and jobs .',

hungry and driven people .', 'There are many PHDs in the world like that : poor , hungry , driven .', 'We are not poor , we are not hungry but I think we have to be driven .', 'It used to be called outsourcing .', 'You find a company in India or China , you give him the job , he does it for you .', 'Now , they call it crowd - sourcing .', 'I put it on the Internet , whoever can do the job , come and take the contract , you do the work .', 'Some are simple jobs like webpage design or writing a review .', 'You can go to freelancer . com , crowdsourcing . org .', 'If you have spare time and want some pocket money , you can just take a job like that and do it .', 'Others are complex projects .', 'The US Department of Defence Advanced Projects Research Agency ( DARPA ) has got a website which is devoted to crowd - sourcing the design of a UAV , an unmanned aerial vehicle .', 'It did not give a contract to Boeing or to Lockheed or to Airbus ; they put it up on the web and you form your own teams and you post your design and people will vote on it and the best design will get a prize and there is a chance they will build the thing .', '33 .', 'So it is a different kind of world .', 'We would like to keep the competition away â \\x80\\x93 not have so many foreigners here because they compete against us , give ourselves a bit more pay because cost of living is high .', 'We would like to improve our lives but we cannot wish away the competition just by doing that .', 'It is there and â \\x80\\x9c thereâ \\x80\\x9d is not across the ocean , there is one mouse - click away and that is the world which we live in .', 'Whether you vote for the PAP or the Opposition , that is the world we live in .', 'So , we have to recognise that .', '34 .', 'If you look within Singapore , you have to recognise another very important fact and that is that our growth is likely to slow down .', 'Our economy is more developed , it cannot expand in the same adolescent way as it used to â \\x80\\x93 seven , eight per cent a year effortlessly , year after year .', 'We have domestic constraints of population and space .', 'Our population is growing , Singapore is getting crowded , space is being allocated .', 'We have to scramble to find new workers , dormitories , new factory land , new space for highways , for parks , everything which you put in , something else has to be displaced .', 'We are slowing down the inflow of foreign workers and immigrants .', 'But that means squeezing out more businesses and reducing more growth .', 'There is a very high opportunity cost .', 'There is a trade - off .', 'Already , many employers are feeling it , especially small - and medium - sized enterprises ( SMEs ), especially those which are run by Singaporeans because they tend to be the less generous paymasters and the first ones to run into difficulty when they are unable to get workers .', 'But it is not just the SMEs , it is also industries staffed mainly by foreigners serving Singaporeans like nursing homes because if you cannot find staff from the Philippines or from Indonesia or wherever the nurses come from , we will not find enough Singaporeans to do this .', 'So we are going to face slower growth over the next ten years .', 'We have made 5 . 5 per cent growth over the last decade , over the next ten years we have set a target of 3 - 5 per cent but I would say if we can make 3 - plus per cent per year consistently over the next ten years , we have had a good decade .', 'We have to moderate , adjust our expectations , understand what is possible within those parameters to the best that we can and do it as intelligently as possible .', '35 .', 'So how can we grow in this environment ?', 'MTI has been pursuing this strategy for some time now â \\x80\\x93

future , phase in new industries , new technology , new know - how , new skills , new trained workers and therefore , raise productivity in every sector and therefore we can share the benefits amongst all Singaporeans who have good jobs .', '36 .', 'What is the silver bullet to do this ?', 'There is none .', 'With hard work you can do it .', 'Hard work educating our young , up - skilling our workers , therefore raising our level and raising above the competition .', 'Not meeting them head on or trying to be cheaper than them , but rising above them , to be better than them and at the same time , making a special effort to help the older workers and the PMETs because I think we are going to see more problems with them in the next ten years as Ms Low Yen Ling and Mr Patrick Tay reminded us yesterday .', 'With the good workers you can get investments , you can get good productive jobs and then you can have the wealth , you can have social measures which will help the yin complement the yang .', 'And we can get through and succeed economically .', '37 .', 'One advantage which we do have when it comes to the economy which is unique to us and very valuable , and I am afraid often underappreciated by Singaporeans , is that in Singapore we can make our whole system work well , not just individual pieces but the whole system .', 'Our unions work with our employers and the Government ; we have tripartism .', 'Our business environment â \\x80\\x93 everything clicks , you can register your company , two dollars and 20 minutes , it is done .', 'You want telecoms , you can have it .', 'You want an SIA flight , you can have it .', 'You want utilities , it is there .', 'It is a tight , high - functioning system where the whole is more than the sum of its parts .', 'It is because of this that Singaporeans enjoy wages beyond what they would earn if the same person with the same skill goes to work somewhere else .', 'You cross the Causeway , you work somewhere or you just go overseas , work somewhere , one of neighbouring countries , any of our neighbouring countries , no one gets the same wage .', 'In fact many people come here to work from those neighbouring countries because they are taking advantage of our whole system performance , our entire system excellence and we are taking advantage of that because they add to our numbers .', 'So we have to keep that and , through that , I think our Singaporeans can have a premium and if they can strengthen that advantage , that premium can go up .', 'Many business leaders recognize that there is this special Singapore premium , it is not just a figment of our imagination .', 'Therefore they put major projects in Singapore even though we are not always the lowest cost location or even the biggest market or their home countries .', 'But they see us , they decide they have confidence in us , they explain to their boards Singaporeâ \\x80\\x99 s performance and track record and , even though yesterday somebody said past record is not a promise of future performance , in Singapore they say you have this past record , I think we bet on them , we have confidence that they would make the future work .', 'They come here and that is why now we have high quality investments even in a quite difficult global environment and when they meet me which we often do , I have met quite a number of them recently , they strongly advise me to uphold the fundamentals , stay the course and never lose this advantage .', 'And what they do not tell me which I know is that of all the economic factors , this entire system performance is the one which most depends on our getting our politics right .', 'A Constructive Politics That Puts Singapore First', '38 .', 'So underpinning a harmonious society , inclusive society , underpinning a vibrant economy , we must have a constructive politics which puts Singapore first .', '39 .', 'Our politics is not constant ; it is evolving , it happens in every country , it is happening in Singapore .', 'Nothing is permanent , no situation is forever , no solution works indefinitely .', 'Our politics is evolving in response to new economic and social realities because our economy is facing challenges for the future , because our society is having greater income gaps .', 'It is becoming more diverse therefore our politics is reflecting the social and economic conditions .', 'There are more diverse interests and perspectives among different segments of the population .', 'We have a better - educated population , they want to hear more alternative voices , they like closer engagement and they believe in a different relationship with the Government .', 'As one of them said in the old days we were here , the Government is here ( PM uses his hands to show a gap between the people and Government ), now we are here , the Government is here , the gap is not so big ( PM narrows the gap between his hands ).', 'So therefore the relationship has changed and I think that is correct and the relationship ought to change .', '40 .', 'The internet is playing a role , it is not just a passive medium but it also shapes our interactions and it redefines our sense of belonging and affinity because , on the internet , you are not necessarily interacting with your neighbour or your fellow Singaporean or even your classmate in school .', 'It could be a special interest group who may live in California or Australia , it could be a World of Warcraft opponent who might be in eastern Europe or Russia or China farming for money .', 'It could be a tiny little interest group collecting stamps or building model aeroplanes .', 'But each person , each group , is fragmented into your little narrow - casted sub - sub - society , not one inclusive cohesive Singapore society .', 'That makes for different politics and we saw the effects this year in two elections , in May at the general election and in August at the presidential election .', 'I think it is necessary and healthy for politics to adapt to changes in our society and to be up to date and in sync with the times .', 'Because if you do not adapt as a society , it goes brittle and one day it will break .', 'But we cannot assume that just because you are changing , you are moving forward .', 'You could be going the wrong way , you could get into a dead end .', 'We have to consciously find the right way forward so as to avoid problems which other countries have run into .', '41 .', 'Singapore is not quite the same as other countries .', 'Many things have changed but one thing has not changed and that is that we still need a capable and effective government .', 'We are a small country .', 'We are successful but our success remains an act of will .', 'Levitate , stay there , do not fall down , do not lose that determination to keep levitating and keep performing and rise higher .', 'If we have bad leadership , if you made the wrong policies or do the wrong thing , you can easily fail .', 'Therefore we are different from other countries .', 'We cannot have a low - key government unlike , say , Switzerland where you just have a council of ministers and the ministers take turns to be the Prime Minister or like the Scandinavian countries where it is a very homogenous society , your neighbours are also successful societies similar to yours and the society can run itself , civil servants can run it and the politicians , well , you add to the system but life can go on .', 'Least of all can we afford in Singapore gridlock or malfunction , which happens in many first world parliaments .', 'Belgium is a very interesting case .', 'In 67 years , they have had 45 governments .', 'So about once every year plus and for the last 500 days , since the last election , they have had no government at all because they have not been able to form a coalition .', 'There is no vote of confidence , so there is no government but the old Prime Minister is still there and he is still conducting business and life goes on .', 'Japan , a much more established society than us , has had six Prime Ministers in five years .', 'I think if that happens to Singapore , we are in serious trouble .', '42 .', 'So how do we respond to this new political situation ?', 'I think first of all we have to take a much more open approach to government and to governance .', 'The way we organize ourselves , the way we conduct our affairs .', 'We need to welcome different views , reach out to diverse groups , including critics , hear them , exchange with them , pick up ideas from them , persuade them .', 'We will share more information with the public , whether it is information on population trends , whether it is information on our employment figures or foreign workers , even GIC investments .', 'We are publishing more information now than we used to do , whatever we can .', 'Not everything can be disclosed â \\x80\\x93 we do not want to tell the world the overall size of our reserves and we cannot publish our defence plans .', 'But wherever possible , we would disclose more rather than less .', 'As we go forward , we will review the rules and what we are putting out and I am sure over time we will do progressively more .', 'We need to engage citizens more in the decisions affecting them across a wide range , from special groups , VWOs , helping special needs children or nature groups or animal welfare groups , to specific issues which are important but where there are specific groups which are concerned like looking at the CPF which concerns workers , employers and older workers .', 'They want their CPF rates revised and the Government is working with NTUC and with employers to review the rates .', 'But even on broader issues , like population , like immigration , I think it is constructive of us to have a discussion , to debate , to examine the facts , to understand what the tradeoffs are , to focus minds .', 'A month or two ago , the Institute of Policy Studies put out a paper showing various projections of how Singaporeâ \\x80\\x99 s population will grow or shrink over the next decade , based on different assumptions .', 'It is not a conclusive last word but it was a very helpful contribution to the public debate .', 'I think it helped to educate people and make them understand what this is about and I think over the next year , we will put out more papers , we will discuss them , get people to focus their minds and to understand that we actually face very serious tradeoffs .', 'There is no free lunch , you can say you want to have fewer , but if you have fewer , there are serious consequences .', 'But the public debate is not a free - for - all and there are risks .', 'The French tried this .', 'They had a debate on what it meant to be French because they wanted to close over some of the fault lines in society â \\x80\\x93 between the immigrants , the Muslims and the non - Muslims in France .', 'But it took a nasty turn , it became a xenophobic discussion , the Government had to try and smooth things down and distance themselves from the debate .', 'So while we debate sensitive issues , we have to be very careful not to let sensible , moderate , thoughtful views be drowned out by unthinking xenophobia .', '43 .', 'So that is the first thing we do .', 'Take a more open approach to government .', 'The second thing we must do is to have more space for civic society and pull the Government back wherever possible so as to have Singaporeans take the lead and act on their own .', 'I spoke about this at the National Day Rally and I described the Yellow Ribbon project and how volunteers were doing a lot of good work helping prisoners rehabilitate themselves .', 'But there are many other examples .', 'Many are talking about an aging society and preparing for that .', 'There of all places we will need lots and lots of civic society to be involved .', 'And some of them are already actively doing good things .', 'For example , there is a Young At Heart !', 'Community College , some of you may have heard of it , it is in Marine Parade , started by the Marine Parade family service centre and Southeast CDC .', 'They call it YAH !', 'Community College .', 'So although it has to deal with aging , they are young at heart .', 'And the idea is to help the elderly learn more about being self - reliant and leading an active lifestyle .', 'The people who come for the courses are trained as community ambassadors and then they go out and they promote awareness of wider issues .', 'So then bringing in old people , giving them some useful knowledge and skills and then they can go out and they can be active in their community and do good and feel useful .', 'I think this will probably improve their mindset and their health .', 'So we need many more of this .', 'One in every constituency times 88 constituencies and even more .', '44 .', 'Thirdly , we need to emphasize how our policies impact Singaporeans and are seen by Singaporeans .', 'Government is not only about doing things , government is also about making people understand what we are doing , getting people to support what we are doing and knowing what people would like us to do so that we can do the right thing for them .', 'And everything the Government does is to benefit citizens .', 'Why else would we want to do that ?', 'We are voted by citizens , our responsibility is to them , what we do must be for them .', 'But government is complicated and very often the link from the measures to the benefits are indirect and not obvious .', 'And so the result is anxiety , sometimes opposition , sometimes a lot of angst .', 'And we try hard to communicate , we make speeches , we have dialogues , we listen , we talk , but as members have not tired of telling us and I hasten to tell members I have heard you , we do not always do it as well as we could and we need to communicate better .', 'To listen , to engage , to explain , to be close and sense one another better , if the policies are wrong or circumstances have changed , then say so .', 'A change of policies , we are on a new tact .', 'But if the policies are not wrong and we have to persevere and the perceptions are mistaken , then I think we have to have the courage of conviction and preserve the core principles .', 'We can be flexible on the implementation , we can be flexible on the details and we have to work hard to persuade Singaporeans that we are doing the right thing .', 'Take the ERP for example , I believe it is the right thing .', 'I think the Minister for Transport believes it is the right thing .', 'I think some members of the House believe it is the right thing and more members understand that it is although they wished it were not so .', 'But it is something which we cannot avoid doing .', 'At the margins , we can adjust .', 'If I can stop ( the ERP in ) Chinatown earlier in the evening , and the shops feel that maybe the customers are less deterred , well , why not ?', 'Let us do that .', 'Central Expressway , people are going home , they are prepared to be stuck in a traffic jam a little bit longer , well , alright , we can compromise at the edges , let us turn it off at eight oâ \\x80\\x99 clock .', 'I am not sure it will solve the problem but if people feel that there is angst , it makes our policy more acceptable , I think it is the right thing to do .', 'Preserve the principles , adjust the details .', 'Politics is the art of the possible .', '45 .', 'Finally , we need to harness the power of the new media .', 'To use it better to engage and connect with citizens .', 'To manage it better , to encourage responsible and constructive behaviour .', 'We need to strengthen what is called digital judgment .', 'And we need to set new norms and rules .', 'What is digital judgment ?', 'That means a good sense to know that what you saw on the website doesnâ \\x80\\x99 t mean it is real just because it is on a website .', 'Just because it is in Wikipedia , does not mean it is true .', 'Ask , find out , verify .', 'We did not invent the term digital judgment .', 'The British talked about it because they did surveys and they found that actually people do not have good digital judgment .', 'When they see something on the web , they tend to believe it .', 'If they hear it from the Government , they tend to disbelieve it .', 'They do not have controlled media , neither do we .', 'But they have a problem , so do we .', 'And we have to get people to be more sophisticated to understand the internet is very good , the internet is very interesting , many good things there .', 'And you need norms and rules to deal with a new situation , not envisage in the norms and rules which had to do with print media , with speeches in person , where now you have anonymous stuff going around , where now you have instant stuff which can proliferate and go viral .', 'So the British and other countries â \\x80\\x93 the Americans too , they have laws on cyber terrorism , cyber bullying ; they have laws to prevent people from misusing the internet to sometimes very bad purposes .', 'You would have heard of one American woman who pretended to be a young girl and befriended another young girl and tormented this other person until the little girl committed suicide .', 'Why ?', 'Because there was some conflict between that girl and this womanâ \\x80\\x99 s daughter , so the woman pretended to be a young girl and did this on the internet .', 'Are existing laws adequate ?', 'Not yet .', 'Do we need something ?', 'I think we have to study how we can do this .', 'It will not be one hundred per cent foolproof , but it will be necessary and it is something which MICA is fully focused on .', '46 .', 'Finally we need to enlarge the common space shared by Singaporeans .', 'This is a broad , continuing effort .', 'The internet is pulling us in different directions , the world is pulling us in different directions .', 'So many opportunities in so many countries , so many exciting possibilities for different people to pursue .', 'How do we pull everybody together so that we feel Singaporean together , that we are anchored and feel that â \\x80\\x9c this is home trulyâ \\x80\\x9d, as the song says ?', 'We have to make maximum use of our schools , national service experience , our HDB communities , our national day parades , events , major developments which we share , things we go through together , whether SARS or economic crisis , so that we have shared reference points , shared memories , so that we feel one together .', 'But it is a continuing effort and it is something which we must pick up .', 'Again , the Government cannot do this alone .', 'Really , it is a national effort .', '47 .', 'The Government , at the end of all this , in a new norm , in a new environment , still has a duty to run Singapore .', 'Having heard all views , let us decide : what are we going to do , this is the way we go .', 'It is what we are elected for , it is what the electorate expects of us â \\x80\\x93 to produce results and to present our record to voters at the next election for them to judge whether they are satisfied or not satisfied .', '48 .', 'The Government is one of our political institutions .', 'The Parliament is another , the presidency is another , and we need strong political institutions to have a good government to work well .', 'And they have to be strengthened and brought up , kept up to date .', 'Several MPs have talked about this .', 'Ms Denise Phua and Dr Janil Puthucheary suggested reviewing the NCMP scheme , the NMP scheme , the elected presidency scheme , and asked whether they still relevant in the new environment .', 'We have amended these not long ago â \\x80\\x93 the NCMP and the NMP schemes we last amended in the last term , that is why there are at least nine Opposition MPs in this house .', 'That is why we have permanent NMPs and we will be appointing NMPs , so that they will be enough alternative voices in Parliament .', 'That is why we now have three NCMPs in this Parliament because it is our intent to make it so .', 'And the NCMPs come from parties which do not believe in the system , but clearly not believing in something does not stop them from benefiting from it .', 'But we have just changed the rules in the last term , so we will see how it works out before deciding whether further changes are needed .', '49 .', 'On the elected presidency , we have just held the first contested election in 18 years .', 'It was hotly contested .', 'After the election , there has been much thoughtful commentary which has been published on the internet as well as in the print media .', 'And the question is : how can we strengthen this important institution of Singaporeâ \\x80\\x99 s government ?', 'In fact , Mr Chen Show Mao interestingly argued the same the day before yesterday , which I note is a change from the Workersâ \\x80\\x99 Party position that the elected presidency is wrong and should be abolished .', 'But I take him seriously and this is something which we have to consider very carefully .', '50 .', 'Parliament itself is a key institution .', 'The Government is accountable to Parliament and we welcome vigorous questioning and debate in the House , so we look forward to joining issue with the opposition and I am sure the opposition looks forward to joining issue with us too .', 'They declare that they will be responsible and constructive ; we will hold them to their word .', 'Do not just criticise what the Government does , put up serious alternatives to be considered .', 'Argue your case , be scrutinised as you scrutinise us .', 'And do not just support popular measures like increasing social spending or building more HDB flats or asking the Government to deliver more .', 'Anybody can do that .', 'Also acknowledge that these measures cost money and explain how proposals would be funded .', 'Speak up for measures which may be necessary but are unpopular , like immigration .', 'Being principled does not mean not being afraid to offend the Government , because the Government is not the emperor and does not chop heads off .', 'Being principled means not being afraid to tell unpalatable truths to Singaporeans , because voters are the sovereign and they can vote against you .', 'But if you have conviction and passion , if you believe in it , then persuade people to follow you .', 'Do not lead from the rear .', '51 .', 'And that applies to PAP MPs too .', 'Speak your minds , speak frankly , vigorously , passionately .', 'We have heard many heartfelt views over the last few days , many of them passionately argued , each in his own way .', 'You have expressed the aspirations and concerns of your voters , but I also encourage the PAP MPs to keep close to other groups in society who will see you as their voice in Parliament - people for whom you are their natural conduit , whether the young , the old , community organisations , clans , sports groups , nature groups , etc .', 'Each of us comes with our own interests , our own connections , our own constituencies , outside of the people who voted for you .', 'Nurture those links , broaden your contacts , cover the natural ground and together , cover the whole ground comprehensively .', 'But as I said , also stand up for your convictions , do what you believe will benefit your voters and what is right for Singapore .', '52 .', 'Singaporeans themselves play a critical role in making our democracy work .', 'They have to be active citizens , working for causes which they believe in , but united by a larger common cause , which is to make Singapore grow and prosper .', 'Interests will not always be aligned .', 'It is not in the nature of human beings or human societies that we are all clones of one another and all have exactly the same ideas and interests .', 'Therefore we need to work harder to build consensus , to compromise , to give and take for the common good .', 'And I think as incomes go up , as people become more educated , this will take more work .', '53 .', 'Take for example the recent story , which many of you would have read , about the nursing home which needs to be built in Bukit Batok .', 'The residents are concerned ; they would prefer not to have a nursing home next to where they live .', 'The concerns have some basis and their emotions are understandable .', 'And yet if every neighbourhood in Singapore rejects having a nursing home nearby , then there will be no nursing home built in Singapore and I think we will all be worse off .', 'It is not just Singaporeans who have such a psychology .', 'It happens in many countries .', 'There is even a word for it , it is called NIMBY â \\x80\\x93 Not In My Backyard .', 'You have bought a house , the house is worth something , somebody puts a facility next to your house , property value may be affected , please put it elsewhere .', 'Next block is all right â \\x80\\x93 then itâ \\x80\\x99 s not too far for me to walk , but downstairs affects my amenities .', 'And this will crop up repeatedly , especially in a crowded city like Singapore .', 'Mr Zainuddin has a similar problem in Bishan because at Marymount Terrace , home owners are affected by the North South expressway acquisition and it is not easy to resolve .', 'I think Mr Hri Kumar is also affected .', 'We are discussing , we are trying our best to help .', 'We have to find fair and practical compromises and if some group has to give up something , then we try to help them in some other way where possible .', 'To make every deal win - win - win , I think it is very hard .', 'But on each deal , you win some , you lose some , overall , painting it over the big picture , we all win , I think that is possible .', 'And if we have good faith , if we trust one another and we work together with one another , I think we can make that possible .', 'We cannot afford to let every local objection block important projects because otherwise , on healthcare , on transport , on housing , on many issues , we will be gridlocked , frozen .', 'And we will be stuck like some developed countries are stuck , where they have no powers to do what is in the public interest .', 'So we need the spirit of compromise and it is this sort of spirit which has to be part of our maturing democracy .', 'So when you say a democracy is maturing , it is not just the Government taking an attitude or your institutions being right ; it is also how the people relate to one another , relate to the Government , relate to the community .', '54 .', 'By building an inclusive society , a vibrant economy and constructive politics , we can face the future with confidence .', 'The next decade , we must expect a challenging environment .', 'Nobody can tell what the next 10 years will bring .', 'It will be a more uncertain and volatile world .', 'Look at the last decade .', 'In 2011 , 10 years ago , if you had looked forward for 10 years , would you have predicted 911 or SARS or the global economic crisis ?', 'Nobody had heard of Osama Bin Laden .', 'Nobody had invented the term SARS .', 'Nobody knew what subprime debt was â \\x80\\x93 had not been invented probably .', 'But in 10 years , three big surprises , world changed .', 'What are the surprises we must expect over the next ten years ?', 'Nobody can say .', 'We can see certain serious problems in the world economy today - America with its fiscal problems and political gridlock so they canâ \\x80\\x99 t decide whether they are going to raise taxes or cut social spending ; the EU with Greece in deep trouble , with Spain and Italy worrying whether they also may have a run and a crisis of confidence , and the eurozone not certain whether it goes forward to be more integrated or goes backward and comes unstuck .', 'These are very deep and structural problems which are not going to be resolved soon and there is a real risk of a protracted global slowdown , stagnation .', 'Just like the Japanese after 1990 was stagnant for now 20 years without being able to get the economy moving , something like that could happen in Europe , something like that could happen in America .',

ask me how things are and I tell them some of our problems , they say , but you all sound so optimistic compared to where we come from .', 'Because if you really were at ground zero in Washington discussing the budget or in Europe discussing the euro , then you know what gloom is .', 'And so we have reason for hope and for confidence .', '56 .', 'Faced with such an uncertainty , I think our course is quite clear .', 'We work to build Singapore , to create a better future for ourselves .', 'We will not have one hundred per cent foresight , we will not get it exactly right every time , but

nimble , flexible , resilient .', 'And in such a future , where not everything is always hunky dory , we seek Singaporeansâ \\x80\\x99 understanding .', 'Please fasten your seatbelts but we are flying safely , take the bumps , let us continue to try and climb higher .', '57 .', 'In the Presidentâ \\x80\\x99 s Address , President Tan challenged us to give all Singaporeans a better life and a brighter tomorrow .', 'I am confident we can make this happen .', 'Why ?', 'Because I believe in Singapore , I believe in Singaporeans .', 'We have changed before , we have made it worked before , we are better prepared now , we can make it work now .', 'We have energy and spirit , we have courage and resolve , we have commitment to the country and to one another .', 'So let us ride this next chapter of the Singapore story together .', 'Ensure that every Singaporean leads a fulfilling life ; give every child a chance to do better than his parents or her parents ; be a caring and

August , we celebrated our Golden Jubilee with a parade at the Padang .', 'For everyone who took part at the Padang , at the Floating Platform , around the Bay , watching at home or overseas , that night was something special to remember .', 'It was not just a birthday bash , we were celebrating something far greater .', 'First of all , we celebrated our resolve to defend ourselves and to survive over the last 50 years .', 'We started out at independence with only two infantry battalions in a rough neighbourhood .', 'But our pioneers were determined to defend ourselves - we built up the Singapore Armed Forces ( SAF ).', 'Within four years , we paraded a few of our units on National Day in 1969 .', 'Overhead , we had one Hunter aircraft and one Alouette helicopter flying the Singapore flag .', 'In the mobile column , we had 18 AMX - 13 tanks , which were appearing in public for the first time and Major Goh Lye Choon was a second in command .', 'Singaporeans cheered , everyone understood what it meant and it was not just Singaporeans who took note .', 'Fifty years later , our pioneer servicemen kicked off the SG50 vintage parade .', 'Right marker , Colonel Swee Boon Chai - first batch , Officer Cadet School ( OCS ).', 'Marching with him was Captain Hong Seng Mak , the legendary Regimental Sergeant Major ( RSM ) - Tiger Hong .', 'Ibrahim Bulat , who trained

much .', 'Take a bow together .', 'Above us , instead of one Hunter fighter , we had 20 F - 16s , flying across the Padang forming the Number â \\x80\\x9c 50â \\x80\\x9d.', 'A Chinook helicopter flew the flag , escorted by two Apaches and Colonel Goh Lye Choon , now retired , was once again the Second - in - Command ( 2 - IC ) of the mobile column , this time on a Leopard tank .', 'That is him .', 'Behind Lye Choon , 178 vehicles rolled past the City Hall steps .', 'Tanks , artillery , AA missile launchers , special ops vehicles , Hazmat vehicles and completing the mobile column we had nine vehicles carrying nine families .', 'They were the pioneers who had served in the SAF and the Home Team and they were on parade with their children who are presently serving and in two cases , with their grandchildren too .', 'And here we have a family - grandfather , father and son .', 'The son is Corporal ( Cpl ) Tajol Isfahan , 22 years old who joined the Singapore Civil Defence Force ( SCDF

'Secondly , on National Day , we celebrated how we had turned vulnerability into strength .', 'We started off with no hinterland and a weak economy .', 'We depended on our entrepot trade , but our neighbours were building their own ports and sought to bypass us .', 'Our workers were unskilled and anxious about their future but we determined to make the world our hinterland .', 'And the tripartite partners worked together , worked hard to create the best workforce in the world .', 'The Government , the employers and the Unions , we worked together , Business Environment Risk Intelligence ( BERI ) every year ranked us number 1 in the world .', 'And with that workforce , we made PSA and Changi , the best in the world .', 'We were a poor third world country ; people lived in cramped and squalid slums , no modern sanitation , no utilities , but we built HDB flats to house all of us and made Singapore a first world metropolis and our beautiful home .', 'Nearly all our water came from Johor and every now and again when an issue arose with Malaysia , some crazy politician would threaten to turn off the tap , to get us in line , but we did not die of thirst .', 'We cleaned up our rivers , we dammed them up to become reservoirs , we built Marina Barrage and turned Marina Bay into Marina reservoir .', 'Our whole island became a catchment area .', 'We invented NEWater and on National Day 2002 , we toasted our success .', 'Huat Ah !', 'Thirdly , we celebrated our journey from third world to first as one united people .', 'When we separated from Malaysia , we were not yet one people .', 'Memories of the race riots were fresh and raw .', 'The minorities were uncertain of their place in the new country .', 'They saw what had happened in Malaysia .', 'They wondered , will the new Singapore Government keep its promise of a multi - racial society .', 'But 50 years on , we celebrate as one united people .', 'On National Day , when the siren sounded , we stood and recited the Pledge together - regardless of race , language or religion .', 'We sang Majulah Singapura .', 'What got us to SG50 What an exhilarating journey these 50 years have been .', 'How did we get here ?', 'I will put it down to three factors .', 'Firstly , we determined to be a multi - racial society .', 'Secondly , we created a culture â \\x80\\x93 a culture of self - reliance , and also mutual support .', 'And thirdly , we kept faith between the Government and the people .', 'We believed that before race , language and religion , we should first and foremost be Singaporean .', 'PM Lee', 'Multiracialism First of all , multi - racialism .', 'We separated from Malaysia because we believed in this ideal of a multi - racial society .', 'We believed that before race , language and religion , we should first and foremost be Singaporean .', 'That was the fundamental reason for our foundation as a country .', 'So we came down hard on chauvinists and racial extremists .', 'We built HDB estates where all the different races lived and mingled together .', 'There are no segregated ghettos in Singapore .', 'We made English our working language and gradually all our schools shifted to teaching in English .', 'We created Group Representation Constituencies ( GRCs ) so that minorities would always be represented in Parliament and this way , we encouraged all the communities to come together and yet gave each community space to maintain their own cultures and their own ways of life .', 'When delicate and awkward issues arose , we dealt with them together .', 'For example , when we discovered the Jemaah Islamiyah group , planning to set off suicide bombs in Singapore after 9 / 11 , we handled it as one people ; we did not divide into Muslims and non - Muslims .', 'At the same , we made the effort to bring everybody together and to ensure that every community could hold his own and not be left behind .', 'So we set up self - help groups , the communities did , starting with the Council for the Development of Singapore Malay / Muslim Community ( Mendaki ), later the Singapore Indian Development Association ( SINDA ), then Chinese Development Assistance Council ( CDAC ) and the Association of Muslim Professionals ( AMP ) and the Eurasian Association .', 'The Government supported them and so we progressed together .', 'Therefore , for SG50 , every community in Singapore is celebrating because every community has progressed with the nation .', 'And each group is celebrating with the other groups because we are one united people .', 'I have attended many SG50 celebrations this year â \\x80\\x93 a Catholic Jubilee Mass at the Indoor Stadium ; the SG50 Kita National Day Observance Ceremony here in this campus , led by the Malay / Muslim organisations but with other groups participating ; a Buddhist celebration at the Indoor Stadium ; a Protestant prayer event at the National Stadium ; a joint concert organised by the Taoist Federation ; the New Creation Church and others at the Star Performing Arts Centre .', 'Here you see , one of the items - a Chinese Kungfu group performing with the Silat group .', 'One function .', 'At one dinner , I had sitting around my table representatives of all the worldâ \\x80\\x99 s major religions and I posted the picture on Facebook .', 'It showed the Rabbi of Singapore together with the Mufti of Singapore and Mr Gurmit Singh , a Sikh leader who was then chairing the IRO , the Inter - Religious Organisation .', 'Each had different dietary rules , each was served food that met his religious requirements , but nothing stopped them from having a meal together and being friends together , in fact , they took a selfie together , which I also posted on Facebook .', 'Only in Singapore !', 'Some people may think that racial and religious harmony is not a problem anymore and that I am making too much about this .', 'But they would be wrong .', 'Race and religion are always sensitive matters , especially for us and in some ways , today , more complex and difficult to handle than 20 years ago , because religiosity has gone up .', 'Many societies , people are taking their religion more seriously , happens in developed countries like US , Britain , Australia , Germany where you see racial and religious tensions .', 'Happens in Singapore too , not tensions but people taking religion more seriously and everywhere people exposed and vulnerable to extremist ideologists , like the Jihadist ideology of ISIS .', 'We are a multi - racial and multi - religious society and we are always at risk of deep fault lines opening up , and we must never take our present happy state of affairs for granted .', 'Self - reliance and mutual support The second factor of our success , after multi - racialism , is our culture of self - reliance and mutual support .', 'We knew right from the start that to strike out and blaze a path on our own , everyone had to pull their weight and be counted , we could not afford free - riders and that is why Mr Lee Kuan Yew exhorted us over and over again to become a rugged society .', 'We do not use that term quite so often anymore , but our people must still be robust and tough , be able to take hard knocks , always striving to be better .', 'No one owes us a living and we have to make our own way forward in the world .', 'But a rugged society does not mean every man for himself .', 'We are strong even though we are small , because we are strong together .', 'The ethos of our society is clear â \\x80\\x93 if you work hard , you should do well and that is good for you and we should cheer you and celebrate it , but at the same time if you do well , we expect you to help others and everyone has to work together so that we succeed as one team Singapore .', 'We have got to inculcate this ethos in our young people too .', 'And that is why we encourage our children to play sports to experience losing and winning together .', 'That is why we send them on adventure learning and character education .', 'To OBS , Outward Bound Singapore in Pulau Ubin and also on overseas expeditions , so that they can toughen themselves up and learn to work with one another as a team .', 'When I was in Secondary four , my principal sent me to OBS , the experience made a deep impression on me .', 'Nowadays , students have many more opportunities to go for adventure learning , here and also abroad .', 'Tanjong Katong Primary School ( TKPS ) had a very successful programme , the Omega Challenge .', 'It has been going on for seven years , the students who have been , have testified to how much they benefitted from it .', 'Tragically on their recent expedition to climb Mount Kinabalu , the Omega Challenge group was caught in an earthquake .', 'Seven students , two teachers and a guide died .', 'We all mourned them and grieved with their families , we held a National Day of Remembrance .', 'It will take us a long time to get over this tragedy but life goes on and it is important that we move on .', 'And I know that the other TKPS students and teachers who were on this trip are courageously doing so .', 'We have to go on with the adventure training , we will take the necessary safety precautions but we must keep pushing our limits to bring up a generation who will grow up tough and able to work closely together .', 'Trust and Good Government The third factor for our success is that we have kept faith between the Government and the people .', 'We have built up this bond between the Government and the people over the past 50 years .', 'The Government has kept its promises , what we said we would do , we did do .', 'We have kept our politics honest , we insisted on high standards of integrity in public life , no corruption , no dishonesty .', 'We are also honest when it comes to policies and when it comes to the choices that we have to make .', 'We do not shy away from hard realities , we do not sugar - coat difficult issues .', 'We do right by Singaporeans .', 'In turn , our people expect the Government to perform , trust the Government to have their interests at heart and support the Government and its decisions to work for the common good .', 'And even in tough times , we can act decisively together .', 'It was like this with our Pioneer Generation , for example on the issue of Land Acquisition .', 'The Government needed land to build HDB new towns around the island to house our people .', 'To build industrial estates like Jurong to create jobs for our people .', 'Later on to build the MRT network to move people around .', 'So the Government passed laws to acquire land not at the market price , without paying market prices .', 'It was tough for the land owners who suffered financial losses , sometimes more than once .', 'It was tough for the households who had to be resettled , lives were disrupted , thousands , maybe tens of thousands had to change their livelihoods .', 'But if the Government had not done this , we could not have housed our population and we could not have transformed Singapore , so there were sacrifices but in the end , it was for the common good and everybody benefitted and I thank all those who sacrificed for this common good .', 'Even with recent times , we had to do tough things together .', 'During SARS in 2003 , we passed laws urgently on the certificate of urgency to quarantine people at home , to prevent community spread and we will ring you up and ask you to turn up on your camera to show that you are still there .', 'Singaporeans understood this was necessary and they accepted it .', 'Recently , South Korea had a serious outbreak of MERS but they had problems quarantining people .', 'It was not so easy for them to get people to cooperate .', 'There was one case , where a person was missing from her home , they knocked on the door , no answer , telephone no answer , tracked her down via her hand phone .', 'She was several hundred kilometers away , playing golf .', 'You can pass the laws but people have to cooperate .', 'From time to time , new tough issues will come up and we will need your support to deal with them .', 'One tough issue which we already have and which will be with us for a long time to come is immigration and foreigners .', 'It is a very sensitive matter , not an easy thing to talk about , even at the National Day Rally and Singaporeans understandably have strong views about it .', 'The Government has heard them , we have adjusted our policies , upgraded our infrastructure , slowed down the inflow of foreign workers , tightened up on PR and citizenships applications , made sure that Singaporeans are fairly treated at work .', 'But on foreigners and immigration , there are no easy choices .', 'Every option has a cost , has a downside .', 'If we close our doors to foreign workers , our economy will tank .', 'Companies would not have enough workers .', 'Some will close down and our own people working in these companies will lose their jobs .', 'Also we need foreign workers to build our homes and schools , to meet our daily needs , we need foreign domestic help .', 'So we cannot close our doors completely .', 'On the other hand , if we let in too many foreign workers , our society will come undone .', 'Singaporeans will be crowded out , workplaces will feel foreign , our identity will be diluted and we just cannot digest huge numbers .', 'Therefore , we have got to find something in - between , make a right trade - off but even in - between there is a cost and there is a price and there is a pain .', 'Companies will still find your costs going up , they will have to pass some of these costs on to consumers .', 'Things would not be as cheap .', 'Companies will have to pass up opportunities too .', 'When they can see the opportunities but cannot get the workers , many companies will not be able to expand .', 'And yet because some foreign workers will still be coming in , there will be Singaporeans who will feel that Singapore is changing too fast and will resent having to compete with non - Singaporeans .', 'Whichever option we choose , it will involve some pain .', 'But I believe that I am doing what Singapore needs and what best safeguards your interest .', 'If I did not believe that , I would not be doing it .', 'It is my responsibility to make this decision , to make this judgement and then to act on your behalf .', 'And having acted on your behalf , to account to you for the results and for the reasons why I decided the way I did .', 'I think I owe it to you .', 'You have elected me .', 'This is my duty , I cannot shirk it .', 'Challenges facing us at SG50 These principles have brought us here â \\x80\\x93 multiracialism , self - reliance and mutual support , keeping faith between the government and people .', 'These principles have made us special .', 'They are not so easy to do .', 'Easy to say , not so easy to do .', 'Very few countries have got this right but by and large , we have got it right .', 'And Singapore has to stay special because if we are just a dull little spot on the map , a smudge , we are going to count for nothing .', 'We have to be a shining red dot .', 'If we are soft and flabby , we are going to be eaten up .', 'We have to be rugged and we have to have that steel in us .', 'If we are divided , whether along racial lines or class lines , we cannot survive .', 'We have to stand as one united people , we have to progress together .', 'We have to be a shining red dot .', 'PM Lee Hsien Loong', 'External Environment How do we stay special ?', 'First , we have to be alive to our external environment .', 'That is a fundamental reality for a â \\x80\\x9c little red dotâ \\x80\\x9d.', 'We will always be a small country in Southeast Asia .', 'This is an exciting place to be , but also a rather dangerous place to live .', 'I have not spoken much about the external affairs in recent rallies because we have been focused on domestic issues .', 'But I think I have spoken too little because big things are happening around us and they are bound to affect us and unless we keep track of events and stay on top of developments , we may be overwhelmed .', 'We have good relations with our neighbours , much better than 50 years ago and our neighbours have done well and we have prospered with them .', 'But it may not always be like this .', 'Even in the next 10 years , we cannot be sure .', 'Certainly , in the next 50 years , nobody can rule out instability , tension , or even war in Asia .', 'Take Malaysia , our closest neighbour , our very close partner .', 'We watch what is happening in Malaysia very closely .', 'What are the Malaysians worried about ?', 'I can tell you what they are worried about .', 'They worry about ISIS and terrorism because Malaysian citizens are becoming radicalised , going to Syria and Iraq to fight , including members of their armed forces going to become terrorists .', 'Some have already gone , dozens are there .', 'When they come back , they will bring back violence , the know - how and the extremist ideas .', 'This year alone , Malaysian authorities have arrested nearly 100 citizens suspected of links with ISIS .', 'That is one thing they worry about which we should worry about .', 'They worry about racial and religious tensions , about society being divided along racial lines .', 'They have had incidents recently like the riot in Low Yat Plaza , between Chinese and Malays , which have prompted soul searching .', 'If they have racial problems , it will affect us across the border .', 'They worry about money politics .', '1MDB is in the news every day and Prime Minister Najib has just set up a national panel to develop laws on â \\x80\\x9c political funding with integrityâ \\x80\\x9d because everybody knows this is the problem .', 'These are Malaysiaâ \\x80\\x99 s problems .', 'Fortunately we are a different country , having separated from Malaysia 50 years ago .', 'But our two societies and our two economies remain very closely intertwined .', 'So their problems can easily become our problems .', 'And if Malaysia is troubled , unstable or divided , it will affect our economy , our society and our security too .', 'And the closer we work with them , the more we are concerned that things go well for them .', 'Indonesia is also important to us .', 'It is the biggest country in Southeast Asia , it sets the tone for the whole region .', 'When Indonesia is stable , all its neighbours benefit .', 'If Indonesia is in a state of flux , Southeast Asia will be affected , as it was during confrontation .', 'We have enjoyed good relations with Indonesia for many years .', 'With President Suharto since 1970s , then with President SBY ( Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ) over the last decade and now I look forward to continuing these good relations with President Jokowi .', 'But Indonesia is a big and complex country and there are different views within Indonesia about its neighbours .', 'And one common Indonesian view about Singapore is that we are a small neighbour enjoying undeserved success at their expense .', 'I told you in my Chinese speech just now of one Indonesian official who explained this mindset to us but I give you another example here .', 'On our National Day , just recently on the 9th of August , one Indonesian newspaper published an overview of the relationship between them and us .', 'And they quoted a senior Indonesian politician what he said about the haze .', 'He said , â \\x80\\x9c I would only consider apologising for the haze if Singapore and Malaysia are thankful for the oxygen from Indonesian forests for 11 months each yearâ \\x80\\x9d.', 'So you know where you stand and please know your place in the world .', 'Do not get uppity .', 'This may not reflect the Indonesian Governmentâ \\x80\\x99 s view , but we have to take note of it .', 'It is a deep seated mindset â \\x80\\x93 that a little red dot red dot should know its place in the world â \\x80\\x93 and this mindset will not disappear for a long time .', 'I once met a group of Indonesian journalists .', 'We invite them to our National Day to understand us and to write about us .', 'So they asked me , the usual questions which Indonesian journalists ask us about â \\x80\\x93 smuggling , about money laundering , about sand , about us taking advantage and so on , I gave them explanations .', 'At the end of it all , they were persuaded , then they said to me , â \\x80\\x9c Do you feel discouraged that you keep on explaining and at the end we keep writing the same thing ? â \\x80\\x9d I said no , I am not discouraged at all , I am quite used to it .', 'But I think thatâ \\x80\\x99 s the fundamental reality and it is not going to change for very long time to come .', 'We also have to watch relations between the major powers in the region .', 'We are friends with all the major powers , with America , with China , with Japan â \\x80\\x93 all three .', 'And people are amazed that we can be friends with all three and they ask how this is possible ?', 'Well , we tell them just good luck but partly , itâ \\x80\\x99 s also because of adroit diplomacy , because we have good officers in the MFA .', 'But we have been lucky , we have been lucky that the big powers have been at peace with one another .', 'And so we donâ \\x80\\x99 t have to choose sides , with one against the other .', 'But will it be so easy to maintain this happy state of affairs in future ?', 'Will the stars always be so neatly aligned ?', 'What if relations among the powers sour and hot up ?', 'There could be a miscalculation , there could be a mishap .', 'There could be a misunderstanding .', 'If American and Chinese airplanes collide over the South China Sea , or Japanese and Chinese ships clash near the Diaoyu Dao or the Senkaku Islands .', 'Then tensions will go up , countries will press us to take sides .', 'You are either with us , or against us .', 'Which are you ?', 'We have to decide which are we .', 'Itâ \\x80\\x99 s not so easy to decide and these are imponderables and risks which we have to be aware of and which Mr Lee Kuan Yew was very concerned that Singaporeans may not be adequately aware of and wanted to speak about , even into his extreme old age .', 'It was that important to him .', 'It is in fact that important to us .', 'We have been able to maintain our security , and our standing in the world because we have a strong SAF so others do not fool around with us .', 'Because our economy is successful , so others find it worthwhile to cooperate with us .', 'Because we have good diplomats and good leaders , who talk sense , command respect and can defend our interests abroad .', 'These are important advantages for a small country which does not have aircraft carriers to go sailing around , keeping the peace and keeping ourselves safe .', 'And we must keep these advantages to sail through the next 50 years safely .', 'Let me just give you two examples of how having good ministers can advance our interests abroad , out of many .', 'Take Minister Vivian â \\x80\\x93 Vivian Balakrishnan .', 'Minister for Environment , Water Resources .', 'Last year , he attended the UN Climate Change Conference which was held in Peru , in Lima in December .', 'Vivian led the Singapore delegation but he did not just represent Singapore .', 'He was appointed one of two Friends of the Chair .', 'The other Friend of the Chair was Norway .', 'And the role of the Friend of the Chair is to be an honest broker .', 'To work behind the scenes to bridge the gaps between the different countries , to help put together a deal that countries could agree upon .', 'So it is an important low - key job .', 'They chose Vivian and Vivian was effective .', 'Why ?', 'Because he was competent and mastered a very complicated brief .', 'Every time he briefs Cabinet , we have to spend time reading the paper understanding the subject all over again and asking Vivian what does all these mean ?', 'But it his job to know and to explain and to analyse how we can protect our interests and not be disadvantaged .', 'But he also was supported by a strong and cohesive team of Singapore officials .', 'Different ministries , each knowing their job but able to work together across the ministries and take a national perspective .', 'So they could staff him , they could work out alternatives , they could propose compromises , they could tweak the language , they can go and chat up different groups and find out what different groups are thinking .', 'That was Team Singapore at work .', 'They actually should wear red T - shirts at such meetings .', 'Vivian and Team Singapore helped the Lima conference to reach a successful outcome .', 'They had to overrun .', 'I think they went for another 36 hours but in the end there was a positive agreement and in the process , the agreement also protected and advanced Singaporeâ \\x80\\x99 s interests .', 'Thatâ \\x80\\x99 s one example .', 'I give you another example .', 'These are all far away from defence .', 'So people understand that even apart from armed forces , we have to be on our guard and know how to work with others to advance our interest .', 'This next example is Lim Swee Say .', 'Swee Say attends the ILO Conference in Geneva every year .', 'International Labour Organisation .', 'He used to go as Secretary General of NTUC , now he goes as Minister for Manpower .', 'This year he went in June , the Director - General of ILO hosted the conference dinner , so dinner is meant to talk shop .', 'And at dinner many of the Labour Ministers shared the problems they faced in their countries , all facing similar problems â \\x80\\x93 slow job , growth youth unemployment , stagnating wages , widening income gaps .', 'It was a very miserable dinner .', 'So Swee Say is never one for a miserable dinner , he decided to turn the discussion around and to focus on solutions and not problems and he did it , the way only Swee Say knows how to do it .', 'He started by acknowledging we all face the same 3 â \\x80\\x9c Dâ \\x80\\x9d challenges , D for delta .', 'Whatâ \\x80\\x99 s D ?', 'Jobs Deficit , Skills Deficit , Quality Deficit , so three Dâ \\x80\\x99 s .', 'So everybody nodded , say yes .', 'Then he said , we all want the same three Fâ \\x80\\x99 s opportunities â \\x80\\x93 future .', 'Jobs of the future , skills of the future , career of the future , everybody smiled .', 'Then he concluded that the solution was to strengthen the three Pâ \\x80\\x99 s â \\x80\\x93 Partnership between the partners .', 'Partners : Government , unions and employers .', 'And he shared about Singaporeâ \\x80\\x99 s unique tripartite approach and sold a little bit of â \\x80\\x9c koyokâ \\x80\\x9d for us .', 'So when Swee Say had finished , the mood in the room had lifted and everyone was discussing solutions and not moping .', 'And the Director - General rounded the discussion and proposed three cheers for Singapore .', 'We must maintain this quality of leaders and strengthen our economy and our defence in order to hold our own with the outside world , to work with others to advance our interests and to protect ourselves when the external environment becomes troubled or hostile .', 'We have to stand as one united people , we have to progress together .', 'PM Lee Hsien Loong', 'Education The next thing we must do to continue being special , is to keep on improving our education , not just in schools , but also life - long learning because education enables our people to be self - reliant , because our workers and students must stay ahead of globalisation and technology .', 'Last year , I explained SkillsFuture , which provides Singaporeans with opportunities to develop to their full potential , whatever their starting point may be .', 'Since then , we have made some progress , for example , we have a SkillsFuture Earn - and - Learn Programme , it gives fresh ITE and Polytechnic graduates a head - start in their careers .', 'They can earn a full - time salary , at the same time learn new skills and then upgrade to higher jobs .', 'We have created the SkillsFuture Credit so every Singaporean aged 25 and above will have initially $ 500 of credit in the account to spend on training programmes throughout life and from time to time , we will top up that credit .', 'Tonight , I will tell you about another thing we are doing , which has to do with SIT â \\x80\\x93 the Singapore Institute of Technology .', 'SIT provides applied - learning pathways for students who prefer more hands - on learning .', 'SIT awards its own degrees ; it also awards degrees in collaboration with respected overseas partners .', 'For example , TUM â \\x80\\x93 Technical University of Munich or CIA , Culinary Institute of America , it teaches you to cook , not to spy .', 'Or DigiPen Institute of Technology , one of the top institutions for animation , computer engineering and game design .', 'SIT is expanding its intake so it can take in more poly students , more mature students .', 'This year , 2 , 000 students already , when five yearsâ \\x80\\x99 time by 2020 , 3 , 500 students .', 'I visited SIT a few months ago at their campus at Dover Road .', 'I met their students and staff , they were keen about their future , passionate about what they were doing and the students relished the opportunities for internships to apply what they have learnt and to show off their skills .', 'And one such student is Chen Zhangkai , who is 27 .', 'Zhangkai is a late bloomer ; when he was young , he played truant , he got into fights , he was streamed into EM3 , almost failed his PSLE .', 'So he took a longer path than usual .', 'From PSLE he went to Normal Technical ( stream ), then to ITE , then to Nanyang Polytechnic , then to SIT .', 'Step by step , persevering , overcoming setbacks , climbing up .', 'Last year , Zhangkai graduated from SIT with a Digipen degree .', 'His final year project and portfolio were good , and a director of an animation studio came , saw it , was impressed , offered him an internship and after that offered him a job .', 'So Zhangkai has now landed himself a dream job as an animator .', 'Well done Zhangkai .', 'SkillsFuture will produce more success stories like Zhangkai .', 'There are always opportunities no matter where you are to upgrade and do better .', 'SITâ \\x80\\x99 s main campus is at Dover Road with branch campuses in all the polytechnics .', 'So we will bring all these branch campuses together and build one new centralised campus for SIT .', 'And the new campus will be in Punggol .', 'Across the road from SIT , we will build a creative industry cluster , in fact , on both sides of SIT .', 'JTC will do this and bring creative industries to come to be next to SIT and to be integrated with SIT .', 'So that students can easily go from classroom to workplace , apply what they learn .', 'Companies can easily go to SIT and get help if they need some new ideas or some problem solved .', 'SIT will also be integrated into Punggol Downtown , an HDB upcoming Northshore District .', 'And the community will share SITâ \\x80\\x99 s facilities ; the classrooms , the workshops , the multi - purpose hall .', 'So , we have talked about Punggol 21 , we have Punggol 21 Plus with SIT , it will be Punggol 21 A - Plus .', 'Here is how the SIT campus will look like .', 'SIT in the middle and you can see the industry buildings on both sides , if you zoom in and take a closer look , you can see the University on one side , the industries on the other and linked bridges joining them up , so people can go back and forth .', 'This will come .', 'It is a long - term effort and the Chinese saying , says : â \\x80\\x9c å \\x8d\\x81 å¹ ´ æ \\x91 æ \\x9c¨ ï¼ \\x8c ç \\x99 ¾å¹ ´ æ \\x91 äººâ \\x80\\x9d â \\x80\\x93 ten years to grow a tree , one hundred years to nurture a person .', 'When we go into SkillsFuture , this is our mindset .', 'We are planting for the long term ; planting seeds now to bear fruit many years from now .', 'Of course , we also will be planting real trees on the SIT campus and when they are grown , many years now , I hope the campus will look something like this , and Punggol 21 residents will be happy .', 'Housing While SkillsFuture creates more opportunities for Singaporeans , we will continue to make sure that no one is left behind .', 'There is an African saying which says : â \\x80\\x9c If you want to go fast , go alone .', 'If you want to go far , go together . â \\x80\\x9d For the last 50 years , we have gone together and we have gone far .', 'That is what we must do for the next 50 years .', 'HDB housing is one important way we make sure that we go together .', 'We started the HDB home ownership programme in the 1960s and it has been a tremendous success .', 'Today , more than 90 per cent of HDB households own their flats .', 'We are a nation of home - owners and we have achieved something unique for our people , home ownership and no ghettos or slums anywhere in Singapore .', 'There is a true story about an IMF economist who visited Singapore , Indian economist , his name is Sudip .', 'And he stayed at the Fairmont .', 'Fairmount Hotel , high up , looked out saw the beautiful city , he said , â \\x80\\x9c Canâ \\x80\\x99 t be .', 'I want to find out how big this nice area around the hotel isâ \\x80\\x9d.', 'So he decided he would get down , walked in one direction until he reached a not - so - nice area , turned round come back then he will know Singapore is like so many other cities in the world , with rough areas .', 'So Sudip came down , walked and walked and walked and walked , he never reached a rough area .', 'After two hours , he gave up and came back , astonished and impressed that Singapore had no rough area .', 'In Boston , I did the same experiment from Harvard , half an hour , I got there .', 'And it is not unique ; every city is like that except Singapore .', 'In Singapore , no matter where you are , you live in a good neighbourhood , you have good homes , you have parks , you have waterways , you can feel safe and secure , you can go jogging in the middle of the night , even if you are a young lady ; safe .', 'This must always be the reality for all Singaporeans .', 'HDB flats will always be affordable and accessible to all .', 'In the last five years , we have made big moves in housing .', 'We have stabilised BTO prices , we have launched 100 , 000 HDB flats equal to four Clementi towns .', 'We have shortened queues for flats so most first timers can now choose their flat in a non - mature estate on their first try .', 'Some of them said , â \\x80\\x9c Please donâ \\x80\\x99 t give me the flats so fast , Iâ \\x80\\x99 m not ready to collect my keys yet . â \\x80\\x9d But we are going to do three more things in housing . First , for the higher end households , we will make more Singaporeans eligible to buy HDB flats and ECs ( Executive Condominiums ).', 'Currently , there is an income ceiling for HDB flats and ECs .', 'HDB flats â \\x80\\x93 ceiling $ 10 , 000 ; ECs â \\x80\\x93 ceiling $ 12 , 000 .', 'We last raised this four years ago .', 'Since then , incomes have gone up further and also since then we have cleared the first - timer backlog , queuing up for HDB flats .', 'So , we have the possibility now to raise the income ceiling and bring more people into the eligibility net .', 'What shall we do ?', 'For HDB flats , we will go from $ 10 , 000 to $ 12 , 000 .', 'For ECs , we will go from $ 12 , 000 to $ 14 , 000 .', 'This way , more households can buy HDB flats and ECs .', 'Secondly , we will help middle and lower - income households who are buying their first home , first timers .', 'We will make HDB flats more affordable for them .', 'We have a complicated system of HDB grants .', 'If you are buying a house , you know the details but the gist of it is , there are weighted towards those who earn less .', 'So the less you earn , the more generous our grants .', 'The more you earn , you may still be eligible for an HDB flat but I think you can pay for a bit more of it yourself .', 'So we will enhance our grants which help the lower and middle - income households buy flats .', 'The way we do that is we have the Special CPF Housing Grant which is called the SHG â \\x80\\x93 Special CPF Housing Grant .', 'We will extend the SHG to cover more households .', 'Right now , the SHG has an income ceiling , which is $ 6 , 500 , and that is half of all households .', 'And we will raise this ceiling to $ 8 , 500 so that two thirds of households will qualify for the SHG .', 'We will also increase the amount of the SHG , because currently the maximum amount is $ 20 , 000 and we will double that to $ 40 , 000 .', 'So what does this mean ?', 'For a median household , one just about middle - income , buying a flat previously they would have received $ 10 , 000 of SHG , now they will receive $ 30 , 000 of SHG â \\x80\\x93 three times as much .', 'The third thing we will do is , to help those in rental flats , to help them to own their flat .', 'With the home ownership programme , almost all Singaporeans have been able to buy their homes but there are few who still cannot afford to do that or have not been able to hold onto their flats .', 'So , for those who have not bought the flat ever before , Minister Khaw Boon Wan recently restructured the two - room flat and the Studio apartment schemes and after the restructuring , I think that will help , it is more flexible , it will be easier for people to buy their first flat , a two - room flat .', 'Also now that we are doubling the maximum SHG , which I just told you about , that will make two - room flats even more affordable .', 'How much more affordable ?', 'Last time when I was an HDB agent , I told you that if you earn $ 1 , 000 a month , you can buy a two - room flat .', 'Now with these latest changes , even if you earn below $ 1 , 000 but you are holding a stable job and you contribute to CPF regularly , you can still afford to have a two - room flat .', 'Come to your housing agent at your MPS ( Meet - the - People Session ) and we will work out the details .', 'There is another group of rental tenants who are more difficult to help , more tricky to help and these are ones who have bought a flat before , but sold it and are now back in a rental unit .', 'They have already benefitted from previous HDB subsidies .', 'So the Government cannot just give them another grant to buy another flat ; otherwise thereâ \\x80\\x99 s no end and it would not be fair to others .', 'So these households find it particularly difficult to afford another flat .', 'Also these households often have many different problems â \\x80\\x93 jobs , relationships , childrenâ \\x80\\x99 s education , sometimes drugs and their housing problem is a result of their other problems .', 'Itâ \\x80\\x99 s not a house being an issue but because their lives are not in order , so the house is a consequence of the mess .', 'I am very concerned about the future of this group because without help , they may be permanently out of reach of getting a flat of their own .', 'And they will be trapped in poverty and their children will be affected , and you perpetuate the cycle into the next generation .', 'So we have studied this problem at length .', 'I think there is a way we can help these families to start afresh and to own their homes again .', 'And we have got a scheme to do this which weâ \\x80\\x99 ll call it the Fresh Start Housing Scheme .', 'What will a Fresh Start Housing Scheme do ?', 'It will help second - timer rental households own a two - room flat .', 'The flat will have a shorter lease , the flat will have stricter resale conditions that can make it more affordable and also may maximise the chances of people holding on to it and not just flipping it .', 'But itâ \\x80\\x99 s not just providing a flat .', 'Itâ \\x80\\x99 s also supporting the family with counsellors , to guide them to solve their problems holistically , all aspects â \\x80\\x93 jobs , school , drugs , family relationships , planning for the future , saving for the future .', 'The family has to play its part , and show that they are putting their lives in order , determined to get back on their feet , committed to putting their children through school .', 'Then if they show that and with all these extra arrangements , I think we can justify providing a grant for them â \\x80\\x93 a Fresh Start Housing Grant â \\x80\\x93 to help them pay their flat .', 'So it is not without conditions .', 'You have to do your part .', 'But you do your part , we help you , you have a second chance .', 'And over time , with guidance , with help , through this Scheme you can own your own homes again .', 'You have something to work towards , aspire to and achieve , for yourself , for your children .', 'Itâ \\x80\\x99 s a major initiative , it will take us sometime to work out but I think it is important because it shows our philosophy â \\x80\\x93 that in Singapore , we will help you but you must help yourself and we do not want anybody to be left behind .', 'Population Finally , we have to manage our population issues well .', 'Because whether our population is young or old , growing or shrinking , that determines how our society , our outlook , our confidence will be .', 'I will speak about two groups tonight - the seniors , and families and babies .', 'Let me start with the seniors .', 'The elderly will always have a place in Singapore .', 'We honour them because they brought us here , they brought us up , and they will always have something to contribute to Singapore .', 'That is why we made the Pioneer Generation Package ( PGP ) to express our gratitude to the pioneers who contributed so much to building todayâ \\x80\\x99 s Singapore .', 'Having made the package , we made an extra effort : we sent PG Ambassadors to every home , to visit pioneers at home , chat with them , understand their needs and explain to them how they can personally benefit from the PGP .', 'And in the process of talking to them , we learnt many heart - warming stories and we collected them in a nice book which we launched last month .', 'Itâ \\x80\\x99 s titled , â \\x80\\x9c Their Past : A Present for Our Futureâ \\x80\\x9d.', 'Quite a clever title ; lots of interesting stories in the book .', 'One in particular is about two friends - Mr Mutu Sammy , and Mr Ching Chong Kwi .', 'Mr Mutu Sammy is 69 years old , Mr Ching is 81 years old .', 'They have been neighbours and close friends for ten years .', 'Mutu lost his leg long ago in a traffic accident .', 'Mr Ching , who is 81 years old , takes care of Mutu - looks after his plants , changes light bulbs for him , drives him to medical check - ups .', 'Mr Ching speaks Mandarin , Mutu speaks English , and they talk to each other in Malay .', 'Thatâ \\x80\\x99 s the Kampong spirit for you .', 'Mutu and Mr Ching told our Ambassadors that they are very happy with the PG Package and the PG Card because Mutu benefits directly from it .', 'There is a PG Disability Assistance Scheme and he qualifies and he gets $ 100 a month , and when he visits the Specialist Outpatient Clinic , the net amount he has to pay is just $ 12 .', 'And of course both are happy to be honoured and to be recognised .', 'We are grateful to all our Pioneers and I think at SG50 NDR , we should say again , thank you , pioneers of Singapore .', 'The senior citizens , I know what you are thinking , who are not quite as old as the PG , you are also very much in our minds .', 'So when we did the PG Package , we also did a special package of Medisave top - ups for those who are slightly younger , did not quite qualify , like me .', 'But I think what many seniors really want is not a package but to age well .', 'Gan Kim Yong leads the Ministerial Committee on Ageing .', 'He will announce an Action Plan soon , which we hope will make Singapore a model for successful ageing , handling this problem .', 'Let me give you just one sneak peek from his plan tonight .', 'Many people who are in their 60s want to work longer .', 'They say , â \\x80\\x9c If I sit at home and do nothing , I will go ga - ga .', 'Furthermore , my wife will tell me to go and do something about it .\"', 'So we raised the re - employment age to 65 three years ago .', 'And the unions and workers were very happy .', 'I think the employers have accepted it .', 'They are adjusting to it and starting to benefit from it .', 'Itâ \\x80\\x99 s still too early to judge but so far , it seems to be working well .', 'From the workersâ \\x80\\x99 point of view , 65 may be too early to stop work .', 'Workers want us to raise the re - employment age and they want to keep working for as long as they are healthy .', 'I hear this every time I attend a union function .', 'I reply , â \\x80\\x9c Yes , I agree fully .', 'We will do it , we have choose a right time to do it because we want to make sure that the employers have the practical arrangements , and you can make a contribution at your company and it will not be a burden to the company . â \\x80\\x9d Otherwise itâ \\x80\\x99 s not sustainable .', 'But we have been working at this problem .', 'The tripartite partners have been discussing this and I am happy to tell you that they have reached an agreement .', 'And the agreement is that we will pass legislation to raise the re - employment age from 65 to 67 .', 'We will do it by 2017 , in other words , after the coming election .', 'Now , let me talk about families and babies .', 'We discuss these as policies - what should we do , rules , incentives - but at the root of this is not policy .', 'It is people , families and their children .', 'Our families are what make life meaningful for many of us and our children are what will ensure that Singapore will have a future .', 'In fact , our children are the reason why we want Singapore to have a future , for them , and so we decided on a baby Jubilee Gift for SG50 babies .', 'And you can see some of the things down here â \\x80\\x93 A box , the strap , some T - shirts , and some other diaper holders .', 'I am glad to hear from Grace Fu that we have given out almost 20 , 000 SG50 packets this year , including one to Tin Pei Ling .', 'When I go around and see parents with the red sling , I will ask them â \\x80\\x9c Ah , SG50 baby .', 'Congratulations !', 'How many months old ? â \\x80\\x9d And then , â \\x80\\x9c When is the next one coming ? â \\x80\\x9d In fact , I have been trying to find a family which has two Jubilee babies .', 'It is possible .', 'And finally I came across one .', 'Introducing Charlotte on the left and Colette , on the right , twins born three weeks ago .', 'I hope couples continue to have many babies after SG50 , but I know it is a serious decision .', 'It is hard work and a lifelong commitment .', 'You sacrifice your time , your sleep , you have to buy milk powder , diapers , and parenting goes on for many years , well after your children have supposedly grown up .', 'Having a child is a major responsibility , but we will help you , because every Singapore child is precious to us because each one is a member of our Singapore family .', 'So when I speak about families at the National Day Rally , I always try to do something to make it easier for parents to have babies .', 'Not just practical help , but also signals to change mindsets and attitudes and , therefore , encourage people gradually to change behaviour .', 'For example , making workplaces more family friendly or getting fathers to do their share of parental duties .', 'If you look at the numbers , last yearâ \\x80\\x99 s numbers seem promising .', 'This is the graph of the babies born every year since 2000 .', '2000 was a bumper year .', '41 , 600 Dragon Year .', 'The next Dragon Year there is a bit of a blip , but what encourages me is that this year 2014 , not a Dragon Year , but almost as big as a dragon .', 'If you look back , it is almost 10 years since we have had that many babies in one year .', 'So it is not bad and I expect that this year , we will have about the same number as 2014 .', 'On National Day this year , we had a record number of babies born â \\x80\\x93 129 , 9th August babies .', 'These are statistics , but what I see directly when I go around confirms this .', 'Because nowadays I often see families who have lots of kids and they are proud and happy that they have many children and they tell me that they have many children .', 'On the Jubilee weekend , I met the Goh family at new Ci Yuan Hawker Centre .', 'I went to see the hawker food , but I got a bonus I saw some babies as well .', 'I started off noticing this SG50 baby , then I counted the sister one , brother one , another brother one two , three , four , five kids in one Goh family .', 'Father was not there .', 'I said whereâ \\x80\\x99 s the father ?', 'Father queuing up for food .', 'So talked to the father , he works in the SAF , mother is a homemaker and they are enjoying family life .', 'It is good !', 'So I think this is a good time to give our families and babies efforts an extra push .', 'We will push in four ways .', 'First , we will help couples who live closer to their parents .', 'In the old days , we used to have extended families and everybody would be under one roof .', 'It can be complicated , but it is also a strength .', 'Now , people live in nuclear families .', 'But many couples still want to stay with their parents or near their parents , or parents often would want to stay with or near their married children so that the grandparents can enjoy their grandkids and the adult children can help to look after the old folks as they age .', 'HDB already has various schemes to support this , we have relooked at the HDB incentives and we will repackage them and re - launch them more generously .', 'And we will introduce what we call Proximity Housing Grant .', 'What is the Proximity Housing Grant ?', 'It is for every Singaporean household whether first timer or not , you will be eligible and you can get it when you buy a resale flat with your parents or near your parents or you buy a resale flat with your married children or near your married children , you can get the Proximity Housing Grant once .', 'But MND will work out the details and we will announce them soon .', 'Secondly , we will enhance the Baby Bonus .', 'We will increase the amount of the Bonus to help cover a little bit more of the child - raising costs during the childâ \\x80\\x99 s infancy and I think that will help because I hear mothers telling me that , milk powder is expensive .', 'Well , that is so , this will be a little bit of assistance .', 'Also , the Baby Bonus is presently just for the first four children , so we will now give it to every child .', 'This will provide support to parents , more support to parents with larger families and also reflects our attitude that every child is valued in Singapore .', 'Thirdly , Medisave .', 'In Singapore , when a new baby is born , you do not just get the birth certificate , you also get the CPF Medisave account .', 'And the account comes with some money from the Government to help cover your MediShield premiums and vaccinations and other expenses , at least for the first few years .', 'And this is called the Medisave grant for newborns .', 'So we will increase the Medisave grant for newborns , we will make it enough to cover MediShield Life premiums until you are 21 years old and also help with other healthcare expenses such as recommended vaccinations .', 'Because until 21 , really the burden is on your parents .', 'After 21 , we presume you will be looking after yourself and this will give your parents greater peace of mind .', 'Fourthly , paternity leave .', 'Fathers play a very important role in bringing up children .', 'You have to do your part , if it is just the motherâ \\x80\\x99 s responsibility to care for and raise your children , I think the mother will decide enough is enough .', 'Right now , fathers get one week of paternity leave , I think fathers can do more , so we will add one more week of paternity leave , making two weeks , do not go and play golf , please use it to take care of your kid .', 'The Government will pay for this one extra week .', 'We will implement this , but the companies have to agree to give the leave , so we will not force the companies for a start , we will implement this on a voluntary basis to give the companies , to give employers time to adjust and then after a few years , we will look at the position again .', 'Of course , the public service , the civil service , will volunteer straightaway .', 'So to all the public officers who may be watching tonight , you have no excuse .', 'The Baby Bonus , the Medisave grant and the Paternity leave changes will apply with effect from the 1st of January , the 1st of January 2015 because this is a Jubilee year , I think we should give all the Jubileeâ \\x80\\x99 s babies this little Hong Bao .', 'Grace Fu will tell you lots of details soon and I hope they will all be happy details and they will help many more couples to experience the joys of parenthood .', 'For Singapore to continue to do well , we must have that resolve to defend this land .', 'PM Lee Hsien Loong', 'Our Identity For Singapore to continue to do well , we must have that resolve to defend this land .', 'We must have that will to make Singapore endure and to prevail and we must stand as one united people , regardless of race , language or religion .', 'After 50 years , this faith , this sense of togetherness and purpose is stronger than before .', 'The Singapore spirit ignites when we celebrate our successes together .', 'When our athletes made us proud at the SEA Games , like Shanti Pereira who won our first sprint gold in 42 years or Ashley Liew , the marathon runner .', 'After the other runners took a wrong turn , he slowed down and waited for them to catch up and showed sportsmanship and class .', 'The Singapore spirit shines when we help one another in times of need .', 'When we were beset by severe haze in 2013 , many people came forward to distribute masks and help the less abled .', 'When a man was run over by a truck recently , people rushed forward to push the truck , lift it up and help the man out .', 'After a bomb exploded in Bangkok last week , Singaporeans living in Bangkok contacted the embassy to offer help .', 'Our spirit shone brightest when Mr Lee Kuan Yew passed away .', 'Hundreds of thousands lined up , day and night to pay their respects at Parliament House and at many community tribute sites .', 'Mr Leeâ \\x80\\x99 s passing brought out so much in us .', 'People queued patiently , they let children and seniors through , businesses provided free chairs and refreshments to those queuing up , volunteers helped out , distributing umbrellas , food , drinks and when the gun carriage carried Mr Lee on his final journey from Parliament House to the UCC , the University Cultural Centre , tens of thousands lined the streets and then it started to rain , what do we do ?', 'Everyone stayed put , it was like the 1968 National Day Parade when it poured on the parade after it had formed up .', 'The funeral procession started on time into the pouring rain .', 'I was deeply moved to see the crowds , stand their ground paying their last respects to Mr Lee , tear drops and raindrops fell together .', 'For all of us , this was a historic moment shared as one Singapore family .', 'We were mourning Mr Leeâ \\x80\\x99 s passing but also affirming what he stood for and celebrating what he had achieved .', 'That day , something changed in us .', 'Our shared moment of sorrow bonded us .', 'Now we do not have to struggle to find words to define the Singapore spirit or to say what being Singaporean is .', 'Now we know that we are Singaporean .', 'Team Singapore 50 years ago , our challenges seemed insurmountable .', 'As a small country , we could easily have flickered and faded into the darkness of history .', 'But our pioneers were made of stern stuff , they were galvanized .', 'Many born elsewhere but deciding to make Singapore their home and their lifelong passion .', 'They dug in their heels and built a nation together .', '50 years on , our challenges are still formidable but they are far from insurmountable .', 'Those people who feel daunted and think Singaporeâ \\x80\\x99 s best days are behind us , they are wrong .', 'Our best days will always be ahead of us , provided we continue to have a strong team , a team of lions and the lion - hearted , leaders and the people .', 'We have had such a good team so far , started with Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his colleagues , together with the pioneer generation , who built Singapore and made sure that Singapore would thrive beyond them .', 'They handed over to Mr Goh Chok Tong and the second generation of Singaporeans 25 years ago now .', 'Our generation inherited Singapore from them and together , we took Singapore further forward to reach SG50 .', 'In the last ten years , we have written perhaps , another chapter of the Singapore story .', 'If you have been following my National Day Rallies , you will know what we have done together .', 'We said we would build more beautiful homes that Singaporeans could afford , and we did .', 'This is Punggol 21 .', 'This is the view from Dawson , I think it is taken from the air terrace , I went up to take a look , the city rejuvenated .', 'We have continued the Kampong spirit .', 'During Ramadan , neighbours break fast together along HDB corridors .', 'All over the island , volunteers have beautified our shared spaces with Communities in Bloom .', 'We said we would strengthen our safety nets , and we did .', 'We introduced Workfare , Silver Support , ComCare , we built new hospitals , Ng Teng Fong Hospital has opened since my last rally .', 'Community hospitals have also opened , this is Renci and Yishun Community Hospital will soon be ready .', 'We have made healthcare more accessible and affordable .', 'We have CHAS , the blue card and the orange card .', 'And we have the PG card .', 'With MediShield Life , Singaporeans have lifelong healthcare coverage

think these exercises are not quite challenging enough , you can try to do these exercises .', 'We said we would create more pathways for children to chase rainbows , and we did .', 'We built Northlight and Assumption Pathway for students who failed their PSLE , because we believe in our young and we will never give up on them .', 'We built the School of the Arts , the Sports School , the School of Science and Technology to cater to varied talents .', 'We built first class campuses for our ITE Colleges , including ITE College Central , where we are now .', 'We built new universities , Singapore University of Technology and Design ( SUTD ), Singapore Institute of Technology ( SIT ), UniSIM .', 'If they were not first class institutions , Chen Long ( Jackie Chan ) would not have given us these beautiful old Chinese buildings to be part of SUTD .', 'But , we are special and we will keep it so .', 'We said that we would transform our city , and we did .', 'Changi Airport is upgrading , project Jewel , T4 and T5 are coming up .', 'The Gardens by the Bay are an iconic and popular attraction .', 'We have beautiful park connectors and ABC waterways , like Bishan - Ang Mo Kio Park .', 'I took Prime Minister Tony Abbott there , the Australian PM , to show him how Singaporeans live and the natural environment that we all enjoy .', 'I think it is worth showing off Bishan - Ang Mo Kio Park .', 'Our volunteers have been active too , preserving nature and heritage on Pulau Ubin , keeping our rivers clean .', 'We said we would transform Marina Bay , and we did .', 'This was

are two reasons .', 'One , I think there are more and more issues which are cross - ministries and inter - departmental .', 'If you are talking about population , it is not just a matter of economic incentives ; it is also a matter of social policies and housing policies .', 'If you are talking about infrastructure , you need a Ministry of Transport building roads and rail lines ; you need MND building houses ; you need MOE building schools ; you may need MCI building IT infrastructure .', 'It all has to come together ; not easy to coordinate , but it all has to come together .', 'I cannot

we can be sure that it will work out .', 'There are several considerations .', 'It is an arrangement which is not new to us .', 'If we look at other governments , they often have â \\x80\\x93 they

in that direction .', 'I have three Coordinating Ministers .', 'I have not designated who reports to which Coordinating Ministers , because it may be multiple reporting .', 'But I think that they will play an important role , pulling the pieces together and mentoring the younger ones .', 'The backbenchers who are coming in , I have got Baey Yam Keng coming in , who is an experienced backbencher .', 'I think he has got good skills , he has got good outreach skills , especially outreach to young people .', 'He has got network with the arts group , particularly the theatre groups .', 'I think he has got good communications skills on how we can get our message across , how we can present it , how it can be put in the terms of the new media if you need to , or mainstream media if you need to .', 'I think he will make a contribution in MCI .', 'Janil , you know him , because I think he has made an impact in Parliament .', 'He is a doctor , but he actually knows about a lot of things outside medicine , and therefore I am going to use him in MOE and also in MCI .', 'Sorry , Baey Yam Keng is in MCCY ; Janil is in MCI .', 'I think that Janil with his skills will also be able to help Vivian , working on the Smart Nation initiative .', 'I think he will be busy .', 'He has volunteered with the SAF .', 'He has finished his basic training , but thereâ \\x80\\x99 s more training to

Shanmugaratnam : So just very briefly , we are not starting from scratch on economic and social policies .', 'We about some years ago picked up pace ; in the last few years on a whole set of initiatives â \\x80\\x93 economic restructuring , SkillsFuture , strengthening our safety net .', 'We have to not just continue that work , but it is getting more complex and the choices we have to make are not simple ones .', 'We will have to think very hard about them â \\x80\\x93 what can we afford , how do we provide the right incentives , what shake - out do we accept in the economy , how do we consolidate and strengthen the firms and our future .', 'It is a task that involves close coordination , close consultation .', 'As a Coordinating Minister , I am not going to be peering over the shoulders of the Ministers .', 'But it is continuous consultation , advice , before we actually come to agreement in Cabinet .', 'And like Chee Hean , I would like to play an active role in guiding and supporting the new team .', 'We are never in an ideal situation for succession .', 'But this is as good as it gets , where we have experienced people still in Cabinet , and we have a new team , each of whom are solid people with their own track records both in and out of Government , and in most countries , you are given one or two years to take over , sometimes not even a year .', 'Here , we have got five years , shorter than it has been for the normal practice in Singapore , but I think entirely doable because these are good men and women , and we have got experienced hands still in Cabinet .', 'PM : Khaw Boon Wan ?', 'Minister Khaw Boon Wan : That we need coordination for infrastructure and development is obvious .', 'We have always had coordination but at the official level .', 'So master planning committee â \\x80\\x93 they are multi - agency in nature .', 'But what is critical now , is to inject this political leadership to make sure that the political considerations are fully factored in too .', 'I will also be the Transport Minister and will have another major objective , which I always feel we can further raise the quality of life for Singaporeans , if we can make Singapore a lot easier for Singaporeans to move about with ease on feet , bicycles , buses , trains and occasionally some driverless cars which you do not have to own it

here to that destination .', 'So I will be sharing over the next few months and weeks some of my ideas and I welcome suggestions and comments from Singaporeans .', 'One critical piece in this vision is of course , a very extensive and reliable rail infrastructure .', 'We have launched a huge number of rail lines , some 60 billion dollars worth of rail lines .', 'When fully implemented , I think it will be a big plus for Singaporeans and how we move about .', 'But reliability , we are not quite there yet .', 'So the last few weeks , I have been sniffing around and asking around for ideas on who do you think is a good rail operator , the best in class and best in the world ?', 'Everybody points me to Hong Kong .', 'So I checked around in Hong Kong and compared our performance and reliability with Hong Kong .', 'Yes , we still have a gap to close , we had made a lot of improvements in the last two to three years , but the gap remains and we will aggressively push to close the gap .', 'At first , I was hoping that in Hong Kong , I would be able to find that they never had disruptions .', 'Unfortunately , I was very depressed when I read that they also have major disruptions .', 'Last year , they had 12 major disruptions , which means one disruption per month â \\x80\\x93 and that is the best in class .', 'So I think , let us be realistic about this complex system called railways .', 'Although it is not rocket science , it is also not straight forward .', 'So the journey forward ; it will not be smooth .', 'There may be some fires big and small ; I will have to get Singaporeansâ \\x80\\x99 understanding and patience to do our best .', 'PM : One or two more questions ?', 'Because I think you want to rush to file by five oâ \\x80\\x99 clock .', 'Second row , lady

experiences , what and how can you contribute ?', 'And my last question is to Mr Ng Chee Meng .', 'You are also juggling an MOT portfolio as Senior Minister of State for Transport , which we all know

Armed Forces .', 'He has been the Chief of Defence Force and I have worked with him and know him .', 'I think they have the potential , and need the experience and exposure to do their jobs .', 'I have put them there because this is a substantial job and also I am able to supervise , oversee and mentor them with experienced former Ministers for education â \\x80\\x93 I have three .', 'I have Chee Hean , I have Tharman and Eng Hen .', 'Actually , I have four â \\x80\\x93 and Heng Swee Keat .', 'So there are enough sources for advice , and I know these two people are able to take advice and make up their own minds .', 'What they will need to do , is to establish themselves with the teaching establishments â \\x80\\x93 the teachers , educators , and with parents who need the confidence to know what they are doing , and with the public â \\x80\\x93 to show that they are able to manage a big ministry , and I have confidence that they will do that .', 'Who will be mentoring them , I have already answered that and I think your next two questions are for them .', 'Acting Minister Ng Chee Meng : My immediate priority really is to understand the education issues with Ye Kung and our colleagues at MOE .', 'It will take some time to consult with our committed educators , our parents and also the community at large , basically to learn about these issues .', 'Also to answer your second question on how I can value add , I think it is a little too soon to go into details to those areas .', 'I think Singapore and Singaporeans recognise that education is one of the best gifts we can give to our children , and we have consistently invested in this area .', 'It is also part of our national strategy to give the best to our kids , to ensure that Singapore can succeed in an increasingly complex world .', 'So I take on this heavy responsibility with enthusiasm , hopefully , with the ability to value add .', 'The way I see education is that it is a holistic approach ,

many challenging Ministries .', 'I will leave it to Minister Khaw to assign me the necessary tasks and I will do my very best to learn about this complex system called transport .', 'Some areas I may have some relevant expertise , in aviation , but will humbly learn from Minister Khaw and see where I can help him do the work at MOT .', 'Thanks .', 'PM : Ye Kung ?', 'Acting Minister Ong Ye Kung : Good afternoon friends .', 'First , Iâ \\x80\\x99 d like to say it has been a great honour to be given this role which I think is complex and important for Singaporeâ \\x80\\x99 s future .', 'I think

and strive to build upon it , and contribute to this area .', 'What is my top priority now ?', 'I think it is to really know how the Ministry works , get to know the people , our partners , understand the entire system and all its complexities and learn very fast .', 'In this aspect , I really look forward to taking guidance from the range of Coordinating Ministers and DPMs who will always be there to provide guidance and mentorship .', 'Really looking forward to working with Ng Chee Meng and being part of the MOE family .', 'PM : Any questions for either Mas or Swee Keat ?', 'Q : Thank you Prime Minister .', 'This question is slightly related to the Finance Ministry although more broadly related to the economy .', 'PM : Sorry , identify yourself ?', 'Q : My name is Rujun Shen and I am from Reuters News .', 'Do you agree with the view that Singapore faces the risk of a technical recession and if so , do you think there will be some special measures the Government is taking to try to revive the economy .', 'Would you be able to explain to us what might be some of these measures ?', 'PM : I think we are not doing a quarterly economic report right now , so I donâ \\x80\\x99 t want to go into the question whether we are in a technical recession or not .', 'Maybe the strategy for where we are going with our economy and how we can keep it growing , although not as quickly as before â \\x80\\x93 that is something which has preoccupied the Minister for Finance , and not just financial issues but really the economic aspects of it .', 'Minister Heng Swee Keat : Well , I think if you look at the global economy and financial conditions , it has been changing and continuing to change very rapidly .', 'Internally , our economic structure is also evolving .', 'So , there is much for us to take stock of and to do .', 'But I think we are building on strong fundamentals .', 'In our Economic Strategies Committee in the last round , which was chaired by DPM Tharman , it sets out the direction in building an economy that is innovation driven , that has high skills , high productivity and a lot of that restructuring effort has been taking place .', 'It will take time to see

one .', 'OK , the gentleman in front .', 'Q : Thank you PM .', 'Faris from Channel NewsAsia .', 'My questions are for Mr Heng and Mr Ng .', 'Mr Heng , you are a part of the group who actually changed the perception that you know , making Every School a Good School .', 'Are people , especially parents , buying into that argument ?', 'Moving ahead , it is not so much the application of knowledge via SkillsFuture but starting from the fundamentals which is ensuring that parents have a more open approach towards education .', 'Is that still a key challenge going ahead ?', 'That is one question for you .', 'Mr Ng , you have raised this point before prior to the elections â \\x80\\x93 how people should change the view of meritocracy because people are still linking it to having a good life .', 'How is that going to fit into what you are going to do because you are tackling the more fundamental aspects of education ?', 'Thank you .', 'Minister Heng Swee Keat : Let me answer that question .', 'I think Every School a Good School is really a matter of deep conviction â \\x80\\x93 that every child is a child of Singapore , and it is critical of us to provide the best possible education for every child .', 'But at the same time , every child is different and that is how our schools must understand the profile of different students â \\x80\\x93 their strengths , their interests , their learning needs .', 'In doing so , they are able to then craft the right programmes to bring out their best .', 'First of all , I would say that all along , we have been investing in our schools and it has been getting good results .', 'Since we started using this term , many parents have come on board , especially in our primary schools .', 'The way that parents are choosing primary school is much more informed now â \\x80\\x93 they look at the programmes in our schools .', 'In secondary schools , we still need more effort ; in particular , in building up the very distinctive niches of the school and creating a variety of programmes such as our Applied Learning Programme , our Learning for Life Programme and the recently announced Community of Pathfinders in Action .', 'We are bringing in people who are successful from different walks of life to help us with our schools , to inspire our students and help us design new pathways for them .', 'I think that will make a major impact in the years ahead .', 'Acting Minister Ng Chee Meng : I think meritocracy remains a very important aspect of the education system and it need not be too narrowly defined .', 'When I look at the history of the education system , we have already started to create multiple pathways to success .', 'As what Minister Heng has said , there are different programmes to meet the educational aspects of our children .', 'Whether you are academically inclined , sports inclined , or in the arts , there are already developing or developed pathways to this success .', 'Q : It seems this idea of meritocracy is still an issue going forward ?', 'PM : I think there will be time for that later on .', 'Parliament is opening in January .', 'We have a Presidentâ \\x80\\x99 s Address and there will be a full debate .', 'After that , we will have the Budget .', 'I think Budget next year will be a bit later than usual , so we have time after the Presidentâ \\x80\\x99 s Address to let the messages sink in ,

have a very strong population response , and our government feels it and understands it .', 'This reaction is completely understandable .', 'But the government still has to do our best to find the most appropriate way to deal with this inevitable challenge .', 'Therefore , we have now slowed down the number of foreign workers coming in , and the number of our immigrants has been properly and

the control of the renminbi , it must be carefully considered .', 'Because this is not only a question of currency exchange rate , but also a problem of economic stability and a problem of stability of the entire financial system .', 'Because all banks , all investment companies , if they are not mature enough in China , are not prepared enough , then open , out of control , I think there is a profound impact .', 'I think the Chinese government Mr .

      "[\"mr . Deputy Speaker president Halima yaku took her oath of office on 14th September 2017 president Halima is a popular figure who is well respected in many circles she was also my former member of parliament who worked hard to serve her constituents yet despite her personal attributes the lightning circumstances under which this government installed her as the head of state have left Singaporeans reeling in its wake in the immediate aftermath of announcing this year ' s presidential election as reserved for Malay candidates the media reports highlighted how the public embraced the move with open arms welcoming a Malay president after a break for 46 years yet as the dust started to settle it was clear that the public was very divided over this issue at public discussion forums such as the one organised by the Institute of Public Policy Studies in on 8 September law professors and retired politicians raised legal issues and share adverse public opinions on the matter social media exploded in critique and satire indeed in the past few days it seems to me that the top government leaders have been going into overdrive trying hard to convince Singaporeans that the elected presidency is an integral pillar of Singapore ' s commitment to multiracialism the government now appears to be well aware of the unhappiness on the ground caused by his maneuvers to install president Halima so this motion does not seek to deal with the wider issues of the presidency nor multiracialism which are worthy of much longer airtime neither is it my purpose to go into the legal arguments some of which have been aired in our courts in July this portion focuses on the parliamentary debates and only one aspect of those debates what did the government tell Parliament was the basis for counting reserved presidential elections under the hiatus triggered model and was what the government told Parliament accurate to cut to the chase did the Prime Minister Deputy Prime Minister tio Ji Heon and Minister Chan too insane make misleading statements to the house that the question of which president to come from was a legal question did the government all along make a policy decision itself to confront president we came we did the government merely used the agency ' s advice as a cover to avoid full parliamentary debate on why the count was not starting from President or King John to answer this question it is necessary to start with what happened in November during the debate on the Constitution amendment bill during that debate on 18 November the Prime Minister told the house the following and I quote the symbolic role of the president is just as important as his custodial role as a symbol of the nation the race of the candidate is relevant so while individually a good candidate of any race will be satisfactory collectively over a period of time we need that mix of presidents of different races and the election mechanism must be designed to produce such a mix over time this is what the hiatus triggered model delivers when should the racial provision start counting the constitutional amendment bill states that the government should legislate on this point the government intends to legislate when we amend the presidential elections act in January next year we have taken the Attorney General ' s advice we will start counting from the first president who exercised the powers of the elected president in other words dr . we canwe that means we are now in the fifth term of the elected presidency therefore by the operation of the hiatus triggered model the next election due next year 2017 will be a reserved election for male candidates that was the Prime Minister speech unquote sir the clear impression given to members was that the government ' s decision to come from president Rhee Kamui was based on the agencies advice that must have been why the Prime Minister sequence the sentences as he did that having taken the AGC advise the government was counting the five terms from President McHenry the Prime Minister did not say that the government intended to count from president we canwe and that the AGC had merely confirmed that it was acceptable to do so sir it seems that the media had a similar impression in a Channel News Asia report on 8 November 2016 there was a headline which read as follows reporting on the debate and I quote next presidential election to be reserved for male candidates PM Lee says the government has taken the Attorney General ' s advise that racial provisions in the review of the elected presidency will start counting from dr . weak envy that was the headline the impression that it was the AGC who advised the government to count from President Lee was perpetuated the next day 9th November by DP MTO ji Heon during clarification time I rose to expressly recall that the PM had said that the decision to count from dr . week him . we was based on the Attorney General ' s chambers advice on how to count the terms I asked whether the government was prepared to publish their advice DPM Q did not reply immediately after a cabinet huddle DP MTO eventually rose and responded as follows on the reserve elections and how to count I would like to confirm that this is indeed the Attorney General ' s chambers advice and if not and you do not think that is correct I think it is possible if you wish to challenge judicially let me repeat what I said on the reserve elections and how to come I would like to confirm that this is indeed the Attorney General ' s chambers advice and if not and you do not think that is correct I think it ' s possible if you wish to challenge judicially unquote Deputy Speaker sir any reasonable person hearing those words would assume the following one that the AGC had advised the government how to count do that the agency ' s advice involved a question of law why else would I be asked to challenge it judicially as the debate went on I was asked whether I was suggesting that the PM had falsely told the house that such was the advice of the AGC I repeated that my interest wasn ' t asking for the agency ' s advice to be published DPM tio then told the house that he would ask the prime minister to consider publishing the advice three months later on 6 February this house held the second reading debate on the presidential elections amendment bill what struck me in preparing for the debate was that the bill contained a new schedule with the table stipulating that the count was to start from president we canwe it dawn on me then that the government had simply wanted Parliament to make new law to stipulate that the count should start from president we canwe it was completely a government decision when I put it to the government that counting from president we canwe was an arbitrary and deliberate decision to achieve a desired outcome Minister Chen Xuan Singh rejected my assertion he told the house that the government had decided not to publish the agency ' s advice mr . Chan for the same coat the government is confident of the advice rendered by the Attorney General we proceeded on that basis during the debates on the constitutional changes in this house Prime Minister Lee explained to all why we needed the hiatus trigger mechanism and he passed the Constitution amendment bill we are here today to put the nuts and bolts in place for a decision made clear by the prime minister during the debates in November and we will not go through this again he continued ms lim once again questioned the Attorney General ' s advice I ' m a bit bewildered by this I would like to clarify a is miss Lim suggesting that the Attorney General did not give the government the appropriate advice or be that the Prime Minister has not been truthful with the Attorney General ' s advice if it is the first then I think miss Lim as suggested by Deputy Prime Minister to can challenge this in the courts but if it is the second then I ' m afraid it is a very serious issue to cast aspersions on the integrity of all prime minister unquote so we should not what happened here instead of confirming that it was the government who made the decision to count from president we Minister Chung explicitly said that the government was confident of the agency ' s advice and proceeded on that basis to make the constitutional changes she said he did not want to reopen the debate on the count from president we even though Parliament was then asked for the first time to enact the table stipulating the count from president V here we were debating a law that would practically rewrite history by deeming president Wei as the first elected president yet instead of the government using the opportunity to clarify the meta and any misimpressions created it chose instead to impute sinister intentions to me and that was how the parliamentary debates on the reserve presidential elections ended sir with this background we now turn to what happened next in the court proceedings brought by former presidential election candidate dr . pan Chang book in high court originating summons number four nine five of 2017 dr . tan sought a declaration from the court that the amendment to the presidential elections Act in February to count from president week in Wii was unconstitutional in other words his case was that Parliament had passed an unconstitutional law in February when it legislated the schedule to the presidential elections Act with the table the counter hiatus from president be sir prior to commencing his case dr . tan had obtained the opinion of a prominent Queen ' s Counsel in London considered an expert on Westminster model constitutional law the advice received was that Parliament ' s amendment to the presidential elections act to count reserved presidential elections from dr . Wickham Wii was unconstitutional the basis for this opinion was that one had to read the Constitution in a purposive manner that is the Constitution should be interpreted in a way that furthers its purpose since the purpose of the constitutional amendment was to cure the problem of five presidential elections not turning out a candidate from a particular ethnic community counting from president we did not make sense since he was never elected this would mean that it was proper to count only from president on King Kong or later if that were to be done this year ' s presidential election would still be open to candidates of all communities sir although dr . tans case has now been dismissed by the Court of Appeal what is most telling is the stand taken by the AGC in the case Deputy Attorney General mr . Hari Kumar the former PAP MP represented the government he made the following submissions to the court before the High Court on 29 June 2017 the deputy AG said and I quote the Prime Minister never said that the AG advised PM to start the count from president v1 PM said is that the AG advised that what the government was proposing to do was legitimate this is from the official court transcript mr . Kumar further submitted that the decision on which President to come from was a policy matter for the government and not a legal question he argued and I quote the AG was in no position to tell the government where to start the count from and call on 31st July before the Court of Appeal of five judges the deputy AG repeated his position even more vividly he submitted that the agency ' s advice was irrelevant he also tried to explain away the PM speech on taking the AGC s advice he said in a code one should not look at speeches like statutory instruments the PM had made it clear from his speech that president we was not a popularly elected president but a president who exercised the powers of an elected president then he says fifth term of elected president a convenient term used in his speech he wasn ' t defining presidency in this context as elected presidency there was mr . Neyers submission to the court sir I was in court when he made that submission which to me was astonishing was the Deputy Attorney General saying that we should not take the PM ' s speech literally but loosely not placed too much weight on the terms PM used in making a keynote speech to Parliament to amend the Constitution indeed the deputy AG ' s submission that the prime minister would use terms for convenience drew some skepticism from one of the judges who remarked from the bench that the Prime Minister was speaking in a parliamentary debate would not refer to the elected president for ease of convenience Deputy Speaker sir the government ' s reference to the agency ' s advice has confused MPs and also the cause the minister ' s kept consistently referring to the agency ' s advice as the basis for the legislative changes yet the deputy AG says in court that the advice is irrelevant I would like all parties interested to look at the court transcripts to see how the cost struggle with trying to make sense of what the government was saying in Parliament with regard to the agencies advice Deputy Speaker the mysterious agencies advice has still not been produced before Parliament nor the courts I can only assume that revealing the advice would not be useful to the government even if one were to give the benefit of the doubt to the prime minister to assume that the PM speech in November was just ambiguous rather than misleading it is also deeply troubling that nobody from the front bench sought to correct the impression given The ministers must have known that the house understood that the government was acting on the agency ' s advice on how to count that there were legal questions involved yet nobody came out to clarify that hey actually it was the government who decided to come from we canwe was a policy decision nevertheless we sought the agency ' s blessing to cover ourselves this was never told to us so as things then the costs have now decided that which president to count from for the reserved presidential election is indeed a policy decision for Parliament the government ' s handling of the parliamentary debates on the legislative changes for a reserved presidential election has been most unsatisfactory here we are debating changes affecting the highest office in the land yet the government decides to engage in ambiguous language and red herrings we in this house should have been told in no uncertain terms that it was the government that wanted to count from weekend we the government should have defended its own decision on why counting from president we was appropriate it should not have evaded the by using the agency ' s advice as a distraction and then gone to court to say that the agency ' s advice was irrelevant sir with the benefit of the additional knowledge from the court case I now think back of the parliamentary debates when the government refused to publish the agency ' s advice despite repeated requests that the government refused to publish the advice because doing so would have made it clear that the decision to come from president we was initiated by the government and the government alone so bida isn ' t me the deputy AG has now told us that the agency ' s advice was merely sought to legitimize what the government itself wanted to do sir the government should have told Parliament directly that counting from president we was its decision and defended the decision on the merits instead it chose to distract and confuse the government ' s inconsistent explanations would further fuel the suspicions of Singaporeans about the real intention behind the legislative changes that resulted in this year ' s presidential election being a closed one ministers shamayim Thank You Deputy Speaker I would like to make a few points first the government has been always very clear and upfront on the policy objectives of this hiatus trigger preserved elections framework it has been 46 years since we have had Emily president and our challenge was how to achieve both meritocracy and multiracialism by qualified candidates from different races can regularly be elected to be our head of state when the Prime Minister announced the appointment of the Constitutional Commission to review the elected presidency system he said our president is the head of state he represents all Singaporeans in our multiracial society as such it is important that the minorities have a chance to be elected and that this happens regularly second the government has always been clear that when it comes to the counting it is a policy matter for Parliament to decide and Muslim protests far too much I made this clear upfront in a dialogue session held after the government released its white paper I was asked the following question when would the circuit breaker to hold a reserved election after a racial group has not been represented in presidential office after five continuous terms come into effect what was my reply the most direct answer is actually the government can decide when we put in the bill we can say we wanted to start from this period it is a policy decision the CN he reported it it is still on record the Court of Appeal has confirmed that it was for Parliament to decide miss Lin says she was present she heard at this judge asked that question that was that this was said why didn ' t you read the judgement there is only one person in this house whom the courts have held to be misleading Parliament and he is not from the PAP only one person after evidence is held Muslim knows whom the High Court held was misleading Parliament so I suppose Muslim knows all about misleading Parliament order the court of appeals judgment makes clear a number of things first the constitutional text is clear that Parliament can choose from any other five terms preceding the 2017 elections second the PM speech in Parliament on the constitutional amendments made it clear that Parliament intended to give itself discretion to specify the last term of president we as a first term to be counted for purposes of deciding whether an election is reserved members can read the pot Muslim quoted from the Prime Minister I don ' t see anything that same because the point is this and we are not changing history here Muslim is a lawyer she knows this doctor we in the second term exercised to the powers of an elected president there is nothing ambiguous about that that ' s a matter of clear law Parliament could have started counting from doctor we could have started counting from an earlier president Parliament decided to start from dr . V it was made very clear and it was made very clear as a policy decision but in the context of that for example if we wanted to start from dr . V are there any legal impediments to start counting from dr . V I ' m just talking about one question amongst many that can arise there number of questions that can be asked and there were also provisions relating to minority rights and so on and I said that we are asking a G C to advise on a number of questions there was on this I think it ' s on the CNA transcript so the Prime Minister was entirely right to say we will start counting from here the next elections will be reserved for Malay president and we have taken advice from AGC what miss Lim is saying is that we are stuck we are starting to come from here because of agencies advice and that was never suggested we start counting we are a careful government we make a policy decision but we take advice to see whether there are any impediment and this government as a rule generally does not publish legal opinions that it gets if it can be done according to the law we do it if the law has to be changed to achieve policy objectives we do it and I set it up front well before the parliamentary proceedings and the Prime Minister was totally clear and the Court of Appeal said the Prime Minister was very clear what mr . Kumar said in court is you don ' t try and take every MPs speech and every minister ' s speech and then try and interpret it as if it ' s a statutory interpretation you go back to the legislation and we had a long spiel totally relevant about a Queen ' s Counsel advice miss lemon knows what happened to the Queen ' s Counsel advice in court she carefully omits saying anything about that and we know how QC advisors can be obtained what matters is what the Court of Appeal has said and the Court of Appeal has been very clear they said the Prime Minister has been very clear they looked at the proceedings they looked at the legislation this argument that it was unconstitutional doesn ' t have licked any leg to stand on because Constitution provided for Parliament to legislate and Parliament legislated nobody is suggesting that dr . V was elected it is say untrue there ' s attributed to the proceedings what is suggested that he was the first person to exercise the powers of an elected president and is there any legal impediment for us to start counting from there and these are questions which others may just decide for themselves but we will usually ask a UC for advice on these things and that ' s exactly what you know if you look at the context we decide and we checked with a GC prime minister said it DP MTO second day said it and Minister Chan said it a few months later the court of appeal as a matter of law said a Jesus advice is irrelevant Attorney General ' s chambers also argued in Parliament in court that their advice is irrelevant absolutely so because for the legal question of whether a provision is unconstitutional all constitutional and Muslim really should know about this instead of spending so much time making a point out of nothing the question before the court is this particular provision in the parliamentary or presidential elections Act is that constitutional or unconstitutional what does the court have to do the court has got to look at the constitutional provisions it ' s got to look at the provisions in the legislation it can have reference to parliamentary debates if the provisions are not clear and decide how it interprets which is what the Court of Appeal did and in that context what one party the government ' s lawyers told the government or what the other party ' s lawyers told the other party dr . tan checkbook are completely irrelevant and that ' s a legal argument Agis he put forward and that is a point that the Court of Appeal also makes but that ' s quite different from the prime minister in Parliament explaining that look you know these are the steps we have taken we have also taken ages his advice he is telling that to the members it ' s a truth but it ' s irrelevant as a matter of law surely you know the difference let me therefore summarize and say this sir mr . Deputy Speaker the government made it clear right from the time when the Prime Minister issued instructions in terms of within cabinet and then set out a letter explaining what he wanted to do the terms of reference and then when the Constitutional Commission was set up he also explained to the public that having a minority representation is an important issue and he wants a Constitutional Commission to consider that issue amongst other issues then we have the constitutional commission ' s report the government made clear in the white paper exactly what its approach was including on the reserved elections and then we explained it on the ground district by district and I said on record and I ' m happy to be shown any other part Muslims suggest that I said something else somewhere else that is quite untrue I am very clear and careful about what I say and I ' m happy to be confronted with anything else I might have said I said this is a policy matter for us to decide and we are taking advice on a number of issues I mean I ' m paraphrasing because I don ' t have it in front of me why would I go and say it ' s a policy matter if I thought it was a pure legal issue so if mrs . Lippman ' s right then I was misleading fall of Singapore mr . Shanmugam you got 30 seconds thank you sir I will use up to 30 seconds and sit down so we are very clear it ' s a policy matter and that is on the record Prime Minister took the same position he explained in Parliament we decided but we took a Jesus advice and the next day d PM q and subsequently Minister John took the same positions did anyone say we are going to decide this way because this is the way that AGC has told us that we have to decide I mean that would make no sense because Parliament is sovereign Muslim must know Parliament is sovereign if that ' s a certain legal profession we can change the law but you know in context you got to read whatever statements are made in the overall context Parliament is sovereign its will this sovereign and the real issue is can we achieve what we want within the current framework of taking this approach or do we need to make some changes I think it ' s quite clear thank you sir the order the time allowed for the Proceedings has expired I adjourned the house can I please read the Prime Minister ' s what the Prime Minister actually said and put it on record 30 seconds yes we have taken the Attorney General ' s advice and we will start counting from the first president who exercised to the powers of the elected president so no rewriting of history here that was mr . Wickham we that means we are now in the fifth term of the elected presidency we will also have to define the race of each of the elected presidents we ' ve had so far there is no practical doubt but as a legal matter we have to define it\"]\n",
      "[\"you ' re with News five tonight the vigorous debate between prime minister lee sin lung and opposition leader lotte account went on for about ten minutes yes that ' s right mr . Lau told the house that members of the Workers Party have in their speeches make their position clear on national issues and that the opposition party has no intention of hiding itself in Parliament the reason why I decided to focus my speech on construction constructive politics because I thought there was an important issue that we should look at that ' s what I say in my speech Singapore is becoming more diversify there ' ll be different views and moving forward how the government would do and accommodate different views and different perspective as an opera is important for us to move forward together as one United people and the other MPs from the workers party will be talking about different issues you would they were covered I mean ranging from social issues social safety net to Foreign Affair national security they will cover the full range of areas and they by we speak our job our focus on constructive politics I thought it was an important issue and of course it ' s important to also understand what is the perspective our PAP in terms of constructive politics and from what the Prime Minister ' s say it seems to me that this mark instructor d - theta on the top of the PAP rather than constructive politics in terms of the society that ' s moving forward and I have a fun my endorsement to what the president I say that we should look at the outcome of constructive politics that is that we should be able to move forward together despite the differences next he ' s talking about the workers puppy pick topping on foreign workers issue I say again I don ' t think we have big plot I have explained in this house of some misunderstanding of the speeches they had big and in any case I also know that when the PAP have to make a policy u - turn they call it policy I don ' t know whether there is a sheep or is of people I think the record will speak for itself when we make a shift we acknowledge a shift when that workers party changes position they pretend they haven ' t that is a difference now as for delegating responsibility for different parts of a budget speech to a different MPs that entirely within mr . lotia camps prerogative it ' s not for me to suggest how he should conduct his affairs in the Workers Party but there ' s a leader you do have a responsibility to state where does the party stand on the big issue somebody can take out look after health care somebody can take care of transport somebody can spend all his time marking Minister Hanks we care on education but where do you stand on what the government is doing is the government doing right is it doing wrong do you agree with the government do you have a better view or do you abstain or do you abstain from abstaining our position is quite clear on many of these issues if the Prime Minister wanted my view on what the government has been doing and whether he has done well I ' ll say well we have soft some of the problems where the Prime Minister has mentioned and the Workers Party MP also acknowledged in your speech but also pointed out there are things that is still work in progress and and the governor will have to focus on and to make it better and to improve so that is the position and I don ' t see the for me to totally stand up I think their MPs will be able to do in our own view and to give their view and their assessment and at the same time wherever possible offer certain views and alternative subjection to improve the policies I ' m very grateful for the extremely reasonable explanation from the member I hope he takes an equally reasonable approach when he comes to election rallies because the Workers Party approach has been to be extremely reasonable indeed low - profile in Parliament but come election time to turn into Tigers and heroes for praising the workers party ' s ability to fight in the elections we have no intention to hire or so in Parliament we seek the Bandit for people to come to Parliament to check against the government and we have done the honestly and sincerely we have not turned this place into into a theater that shows we are responsible we will behave continuously as a rational and responsible party and it members would I believe members who agreed the Workers Party has been rational we are not come here with some war policies or worse objections we debate the policies we came up with some suggestions but these are not bankrupting the government offer or suggesting to use a visa election I think we also rational we don ' t accuse the PAP of something that you cannot substantiate or I know we can sue so I think we ' re fine and election is elections and I thank the Minister for publishers for noting that we can finally I ' m sure that we happy tend to you are the government and you have been the governing path for 50 years so you ' ve got more much people telling the people than the Workers Party how can you say that we are tiger we are something else in Parliament I ' m sure the PAP can equally be bygones he ' s an eloquent explanation for why the Workers Party has been inarticulate about many things in a serious Parliament the government presents its policies the opposition presents its alternatives the Workers Party may not have alternatives on every issue you may not have a full range of all the complexities of designing an HDTV scheme or MediShield scheme you do have a responsibility to say which direction are we going and that direction has to be said clearly not to explain to the PAP but to explain to Singaporeans what you stand for and what you stand for cannot be what the PP is doing and a little bit better that means you have no stand wherever the PAP is standing ask them to do better that ' s easy I can do that too but where do you stand where are we totally wrong where do you think this is a completely different way to do things better where do you think in principle we do not want Singapore to be like this these are big issues which deserve to be debated and not delighted over and avoided in the house and that is what a first world Parliament should be about now see that the Prime Minister is reasonable to say that the Workers Party may not have come up be able to come we ought alternative policy that ' s true but to say that the Workers Party has no position a major issue that is not true I think we did state our position in Parliament with debate with the beta major policy vigorously we didn ' t oppose other policies but where we think that there is a need for us to oppose adding concern the future of Singapore like the population white paper we do so so with the opposition on important issues we didn ' t oppose four things that we think are doing right he said not in love I think he is useful to bring it down to something very specific let ' s come back to the population white paper during the debate the position taken by the Workers Party is that enough is enough zero growth we have continued to grow I have not heard the Workers Party demand zero growth today do you still demand that or do you now think that we should allow SMEs to survive in Singapore we had made a calculation at a point time of debating the population white paper and we continue to allow the following workers to grow we were it will be untenable in the future generations feature population growth and they buy we decided that we need to keep the population number in check and one way of doing it of course is to freeze the foreign workers growth in number our calculation was that probably between that existing number of the foreign worker you can still move around with some sectors I mean only so much of foreign worker and thereby you can still get by with the zero population zero foreign workers grow we understand perfectly the possibility and the trade - off there is our position at a point in time we have not objected subsequently or grieve the government fault why are not doing it because that ' s our view there is zero population growth but the government decided otherwise there ' s a way of doing it we have said our piece but we have to respect the decision or a government to move on but our message has got across we cannot sub same continuously the kind of population grow plan the government is our planning and I ' m glad to hear today that you know promised are saying that we are the government is the king of a serious view or tightening and watching the grow up population to all this complicated TEDx when I don ' t know whether missile audience still stands by what was said in Parliament in the whitepaper debate last year because if he really does after all the explanation he should say we have too many foreign workers now sent home 70 , 000 then we will know where he stands but after telling me that you can massage this and some people can do less and others can do and we ' ll need more that ' s easy to say who ' s going to do the massaging of course the government and that is the mark of a substandard opposition I disagree this is of a substance substandard position this is the mud of an OP responsible position not a gem of the government allowing the government after giving our view debating it allowing the government to move forward not to jam up the government so it is a map of responsible government and a map of first war Parliament we have to call a spade a spade if you have changed the position and your previous position was wrong Cecil if you hold by opposition have your guts to reaffirm it and take their consequences but to weasel the way play with words avoid the issue and then claim to be responsible that is what we fear can drive Singapore ' s politics into the same place where every many other countries have gone and that ' s a wrap of the big story then best debates in Parliament today the sitting continues tomorrow Thank You Sharon\"]\n",
      "[\"vulnerable members thank you for your support your kind words and for electing me as a temp Speaker of Parliament since our first legislative assembly I would also like to thank the members of the public who have expressed support for my nomination when announcement came out just under a week ago indeed many were surprised and it sparked off some discussion about the role of the speaker it ' s not a bad thing we do need fellow Singaporeans to be involved to gain a deeper understanding of not just the role of the speaker but also that of Parliament its proceedings and how all of us here contribute to making Singapore better home for people as members of parliament whatever all stripes we need to be accessible we need to be relevant we need to be real we need to present the voices and needs of our individual constituents but we need also to stand for a united Singapore to speak with one voice in a visit first of all the business of parliament is multifarious in the first session of Parliament in December 1965 we saw the presentation of bills that ensure Singapore ' s independence as well as the first budget which assured her defence it also oversaw bills on the care of orphans and widows destitute persons as well as the incorporation of the Singapore Asian seaman ' s club incorporation ordinance members will also know that in that session the Barisan socialists which is the main opposition force in Singapore then had boycotted Parliament among other things they said that this was because Parliament was giving legal seal to our departure from Malaysia which they saw as a neo - colonialist plot to divide and rule they also saw it as legal cover for our abuse of public funds and as a platform for propaganda to cheat the people and confuse them today the Berenstain is no more but opposition voices are well represented and part paid fully we have six members of the Workers Party reformed the Baris unmerge in 1988 free Workers Party non constituency MP as well as nine nominated members of parliament in a parliamentary democracy the legitimacy of the laws we enact rests on the scrupulous attention we on both sides of the house pay to the reason debate which accompanies the passing of each law no one doubts that our goal in these sittings must be to advance the interests of all Singaporeans I therefore see the presence of our opposition colleagues here in the House today as a strength and a positive step towards constructive contestation of ideas such contestation will become even more complex in the future why well we live in an era where information flows almost unbounded and in copious volume the world continues to change with ever accelerating speed we feel uncertain the challenge therefore is to discern to sense make to find clarity and ultimately to provide direction the term fake news is oxymoronic because fake news is not news but lies putting on a sheep ' s coat does not make these false who true but yet we have seen time and again across the wall how misinformation can have serious impact on people ' s lives at the same time new platforms allow people ' s views to be channel very directly to our leaders very involved discourse is also taking place outside this house as people are more aware they are more informed this is the environment in which we operate therefore to be effective we do need to engage beyond this house to tap on the collective wisdom there lies without what we all need to be grounded and engaged let us be clear the buck stops here we need to be the institution that channels and reflects the voices of the people so that we can query answer and debate in a manner that provides hope and clarity we need to be a beacon from where Singaporeans can take reference with confidence when addressing and understanding issues that matter greatly for collective well - being to be this beacon and to do this well we need to gain the trust and the respect of the public we therefore need to uphold the honor and dignity of this house in the way we conduct our proceedings I want to facilitate good free - flowing debate vigorously by the same time maintain mutual respect do not abuse our parliamentary privileges and to keep to the standing orders I will be impartial and fair but I will also be firm now before I Anne allow me to say a few words about my predecessor first my sincere and deep thanks to madam Halima Yakov for her generosity and advice and support as I assume this appointment she has more than enough on her plate at the moment but as this is typical of her she has made time for me in her diet in the diary she is a woman that she is and for that I ' m grateful last but not least I look forward to working alongside all of you as your speaker earlier I had referred to that first session of Parliament in 1965 at the time the first Finance Minister mr . Lim Kim Sun recounted the loss of seventy million dollars in revenue as a result of our independence no small amount for Singapore since our total budget at the time was only 205 million dollars but the Prime Minister then recounted it cheap as a price of independence and he said be that as it may perhaps it was our good fortune that you get a circumstance where someone with an antique gold sovereign goes and exchange it for a bag full of sweets and who are we to explain when we have found ourselves the proper Sasser of an antique gold piece we today remain the possessor of this peace which we have burnished to a shine and multiplied several times over our focus is and must be to ensure that these gold pieces work better for Singaporeans for Singapore for today and compound it in force for all our tomorrow ' s thank you\"]\n",
      "[\"mr . speaker sir I rise in support of the motion the President ' s speech marks the formal opening of the Parliament session the speech itself describes the government ' s agenda for the rest of the term the agenda to the speech then lay out the specific programs of each ministry this is a tradition we inherited from the UK where the Queen delivers a speech drafted by the elected government although it ' s called the Queen ' s speech and the speech highlights the government ' s legislative programme however our president ' s speech this year is slightly different it sets out not only the programme for the current term but also longer - term priorities beyond this term of government the speech took this approach because Parliament is reopening at a special moment in our history the world situation is very uncertain the global order which is based on openness globalization and free trade has come under great pressure relations between the big powers especially the US and China and also the US and Russia are under stress it is not clear whether the institutions and the international rules that have underpinned world peace and security for the last few decades will change and if they change there will be significant long - term implications for Singapore Singapore too is at a turning point we are opening a new chapter after sg50 it will be a new phase of our social and economic development we have the responsibility and the privilege of reimagining and rebuilding Singapore over the next 50 years and more we are also going through a significant generational change a new generation born long after independence is coming to the fore with different views and aspirations we are also in the midst of a political transition with a fourth generation ministers preparing to take over within the next few years therefore it ' s timely for the government to set out a broader vision a longer - term agenda in the president speech I asked the four G ministers to draft the president speech because they will have to carry out this agenda continuing beyond my time as Prime Minister I gave my inputs and I endorsed what they produce because s p . m .\", \"I ' m still ultimately responsible for the government ' s agenda but my main role is to be supportive to help the four G ministers present and implement the agenda and to see through as much of it as possible while I am p . m . today I ' ll speak about five aspects of the President ' s speech first coping with external challenges next growing our economy third ensuring social mobility fourth maintaining social cohesion and finally ensuring good politics and leadership let me start with the external environment globalization which has delivered growth and stability for many countries including Singapore has come under pressure countries particularly in the West are questioning the benefits of openness and free trade and of the free movement of people the US has been thus far the champion and sponsor of the post - war international system they promoted free trade they opened their own doors to immigrants they were generous to others sharing technology and know - how they spent blood and treasure to maintain global peace they believed that all this was in their own enlightened self - interest but now many Americans no longer believe this including the Trump administration they feel that other countries are benefitting more from the global system and benefiting at the expense of the u . s . we want to make sure that the US will always benefit directly item - by - item country by country and not just generally from upholding a system which is good for everybody and therefore indirectly good for the u . s . so the US has made trade a top issue especially trade with China the trade tensions between US and China hurt business but more broadly their unilateral and tit - for - tat actions undermine the multilateral trading system in other words it ' s not just that two participants who are affected or the amount of whether it ' s steel or aluminum or soya beans or cars which is not exported and which can ' t be traded but the whole multilateral system the system of rules which ensures that countries big and small have played on a level playing field have their place in the Sun and can contribute to and benefit from this international network of cooperation and is a system which we have depended upon in Singapore therefore the trade tensions threaten global prosperity especially for smaller countries like Singapore the trade disputes can also affect the overall relations between the powers the US and China are jockeying for position and advantage the u . s . is still strong especially militarily but China is growing in power influence and confidence increasingly the US has to accommodate China and if there ' s mutual distrust and rivalry between the two it is about a small step from a trade agreement trade disagreement to a wider and more serious quarrel the US and China are far from going to war with each other but it is not clear which way their relations will tilt if they tilt towards more conflict it will be bad be bad not only for the two powers but for the rest of the world as well that ' s obvious but if relations tilt to the other extreme and the two powers agreed to divide up the world between them and set rules that only benefit them that would be just as detrimental especially for small countries which have no see as a small and open country Singapore will always be vulnerable to what happens around us as miss Lee Kuan Yew used to say when elephants fight the grass suffers but when they make love the grass suffers also therefore we must be aware of what ' s happening around us and prepare ourselves for changes and surprises close to home Malaysia saw historic change last week in his general election bakudan harapan led by a tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad now forms the government for the first time ever in Malaysia the ummno led Barisan Nasional lost power this is a momentous development as militias closest neighbor we need to play close attention to our relationship with them the two countries have deep historical economic and people - to - people ties we hope Malaysia is stable and prosperous we ' ve enjoyed good relations with Malaysia under the former Prime Minister Najib Razak and cooperated on major projects that benefit both sides we have also worked with Dr Mahathir and several of his team before we completed joint projects with Malaysia when Dr Mahathir was last the Prime Minister including building the second link at plus and I also know mr . annoy Brahim well because he was my counterpart when I was Deputy Prime Minister the expectations of a new Malaysian government are very high and I think Dr Mahathir will be very busy in the days to come but I plan to visit Malaysia on Saturday to meet of the Mahathir and to tell him that I look forward to working with him again for mutual benefit Indonesia is having elections to local elections this year and national elections the next I have good working relations with President jokowi as I did with President Yudhoyono before I hope we can maintain friendly and productive ties with Indonesia - regardless of political cycles or election outcomes we will work hard on with our two neighbors their success makes for a more peaceful and prosperous region and that is good for us in the president speech she spoke about how Singapore must remain a nation of opportunities this to me is the heart of our nation building journey our forefathers came to this land because they sought better lives for themselves in their families when independence was thrust upon us and the odds were stacked against us our pioneer generation Dagon and slob to build a nation their children and grandchildren took up the torch after them and improved Singapore year by year this sense of opportunity of possibility hope is the spark that has inspired generations of Singaporeans to dream big and to work hard to realize those dreams we must always sustain this confidence that we can build a better life for ourselves and future generations of Singaporeans that we can make tomorrow better than today nationally this means growing our economy creating new possibilities and expanding our horizons individually it means improving the life of every Singaporean in a fair and open and a cohesive society one of the top priorities of the government is therefore to keep the economy growing we ' re in a strong position today because our economy has grown steadily for the past 50 years and more we ' ve enjoyed high growth for much of this half - century even from time to time exceeding 10 % per annum since independence in 1965 our GDP has grown more than 40 times in real terms today our per capita income is higher than Japan ' s we can see in all our lives now that we have become more developed our growth forecast is moderated to two to four percent this has made some people anxious they worry that their children will not have better lives then they themselves do today but let me put the numbers in perspective first 2 to 4 percent is in fact quite good for mature economy South Korea and Taiwan are growing around this rate - Japan is growing even slower second 2 to 4 percent is just an estimate based on our current stage of economic development it is not the limit to our efforts or to our ambitions individual companies and individual industries can certainly do better especially if they come up with a new more innovative product or if they expand into new markets till virgin ground we are pushing ahead with our economic upgrading we can see the opportunities the only question is whether we can seize them take for example the digital economy a lot is happening around us in Indonesia in Jakarta the tech scene is vibrant buzzing with energy and talent and Indonesia has produced for unicorns unicorns are not animals there are companies which have become worth more than 1 billion and Indonesia has four of them gorgeou travel oka boo kalapa and tokopedia Vietnam Thailand and Malaysia have lively tech sectors - so if we can build up our own tech sector while connecting with us we will prosper together we are making good progress also developing frontier technologies in artificial intelligence in tech in advanced manufacturing we ' ve attracted leading AI researchers and companies to Singapore NTU has built a reputation as a leading Centre in AI the Alibaba Group recently opened a Research Institute on AI together with NTU which is its first Research Institute outside China when I visited Beijing recently I went to see PD juicing it ' s the equivalent of grab or uber and I met some NTU graduates a and the TT CTO chief technology officer Bob Chang told me the graduates are doing very well so our people are well prepared in FinTech mas has developed Singapore to become a fin tech hub just within the last two or three years the right rules the right encouragement the right openness the right light touch and the flower blossoms they have green fingers more than 400 FinTech firms are now based here and so are over 30 innovation labs and research centers set up by MNCs in advanced manufacturing a - star is collaborating with multinationals with local companies and universities to develop new technologies in aerospace and precision engineering for example we have a joint laboratory with rolls - royce and Singapore aero engine services that was open last year and these will create these projects will create good manufacturing jobs and SMEs will benefit and so will workers because through these research collaborations they will get access to the new technologies so there are many possibilities for us to grow our economy and to reinvent and redevelop Singapore but growth alone is not enough individual Singaporeans must see progress in their lives must feel that the future is bright and must know that each one of us has our stake in it and this means sharing growth widely and equitably to improve the lives of all Singaporeans it also means fully maximizing the talents and efforts of our people and getting the most capable pianned reliable people into the most consequential jobs where they can make the most difference and the greatest contribution in other words making sure there ' s social mobility so that our meritocracy continues to work how do we know if our meritocracy is working well first of all every tile must have a good start in life regardless of which family you were born into secondly every talent has to be recognized and developed to the fullest thirdly every opportunity has to be open to anyone with the right attitude and ability and finally a capable person must face minimal social impediments minimal social impediments to being accepted to contribute to be in a position to lead in society and in the long term this last part keeping the social impediments down is the most difficult to sustain we want Singapore society to maintain an informal and egalitarian tone where people interact freely and comfortably as equals and there are no rigid class distinctions or barriers that keep good people down this is important but it is beyond the government ' s ability to bring about alone Society itself has to be open and permeable each one of us must carry those attitudes those value those norms that willingness to welcome talent welcome ability to keep the system the way it is any society which has been stable for a long time tends to stratify and it becomes less socially mobile for example the UK and India have long entrenched hierarchies and very fixed notions of class or in India caste which they have found very difficult to overcome Singapore is still a young country of 50 years and notions of class and hierarchy have not yet calcified our social queues our markers our norms they ' re still evolving and we don ' t want them to evolve in the wrong direction and contribute to caste divisions and rigidities social cues are important because they become they can become ways to pigeonhole or to exclude others knowingly or unknowingly in Britain your accent the way you speak can define your status in society do you have a posh public school accent do you speak like a professional who ' s been to Oxbridge do you speak as a working - class person with a local accent regional accent do you speak cockney twang then you know you come from a certain part of London and you are a certain class of person not very high up the totem pole so George Bernard Shaw an Englishman ' s way of speaking absolutely classifies him classifies him it ' s a pun it pigeonholes him into his social class you listen to him you know do you respect him do you look down on him do you give him orders or do you say yes sir and he went on to say absolutely classifies him the moment he talks he makes some other Englishmen despise him and it ' s true if we don ' t have an upper - class accent your markdown straight away and that is why Singapore schools put emphasis on teaching students who speak good English otherwise those children whose parents already speak good English at home will be fine but others will grow up at a permanent disadvantage and without everyone being proficient speaking standard English Singlish will become a class marker in other words if you can ' t speak proper English while you are down there if you can ' t speak proper English the doors opened for you and I think this would close the doors on many from less privileged families and that ' s why MCI continues to have campaigns to teach people to speak proper English there are other social markers that can signal an entrenched class differences members may recall the recent fasts over an unauthorised secondary school social studies textbook guidebook it contained a table that had sweeping generalizations about people in Singapore from high and low social economic statuses SES for instance supposedly low SES speaks English play soccer or basketball and eat at hawker centres while high SES speak formal English play golf or tennis and only eat at fine restaurants the story went viral many Singaporeans were appalled and rightly so luckily it was not a guidebook approved by a mooie lifestyle choices can indeed become separators in society distinguishing marks what you eat how you dress where you go for holidays what games you play what clubs you belong to in every society people have ways to show who is in and who ' s out you take one look at a person or you listen to him to fall moment and you can already place him there are distinctions in Singapore society too but the general tone in Singapore is one of restraint if you wear chunky gold watch and dressed flashily instead of being impressed people may think you are alone shocked and that is as it should be we must discourage people from flaunting their social advantages we should frown upon those who go for ostentatious displays of wealth and status or worse look down on others less well - off and privileged we should emphasize our commonalities not accentuate our differences and so you see if you look around the chamber everybody in formally dressed discussing serious matters of state in any other parliamentary chamber in this part of the world or anywhere in the world we ' ll all be talked up in our Sunday best just to show that we are somebody in society but that ' s not the Singapore way there ' s a further obstacle to social mobility elite groups who become closed circles preventing outsiders from getting in every society has it elite they occupy the key leadership positions in society in government in academia in business in professions in politics members of the elite share similar backgrounds interests social spaces they may be alumni of the same schools they may have done business with on another they may have worked in the same professions there they know one another they have interacted with one another in different roles over long periods through their lives such networks are natural structures in society they are useful for people to get know to know one another to get things done informally to share an implicit understanding of the interests of their society and to feel a collective sense of responsibility for the society and such networks are an important part of our social capital but social networks must always remain open and permeable they must not close up they must not form glass ceilings it must not be difficult or impossible for others with talent or ability but lacking the right backgrounds and connections to be welcomed into the elite group to rise to the top to take their rightful place and make their full contribution if this happened not only with social mobility be frustrated but soon the elite group would start to only look after its own interests and fail in their duty to lead and to care for the rest of the society and that would be disastrous for Singapore let me share something which only can ' t told me recently RI raffles institution is one of our most popular schools I didn ' t go to RI but I can tell you it ' s a good school it has a strong tradition of accepting students from diverse backgrounds so long as they make the cut but over the years RI has become less diverse the new RI principal has been putting in the effort speaking to parents of potential students and primary schools across Singapore to encourage them to apply to RI to his surprise some of the parents told him they didn ' t want to send their child why not because they thought their child couldn ' t cope with the academic demands but because they feared he wouldn ' t be able to fit in with other more well - off students actually I think this fear is unfounded because in reality RI students do come from varied backgrounds and just over half of the students live in public housing 53 % and all of the students get along confidently and comfortably and bursaries and scholarships are readily available so no parent needs to worry that he can ' t afford to send his child to RI or that his child will feel out of place but if such a perception exists and discourages promising students from applying to the school is not good for RI is not good for Singapore and I knows what it has to do in order to uphold its egalitarian tradition MOU will work with them and other popular schools too so that these schools never become self - perpetuating closed circles government policies and programs must and do support social mobility and meritocracy we make sure the fundamentals are done well quality education home ownership and affordable health care which improve the lives of every Singaporean we give everyone a good education and now we ' re investing heavily in preschool to give all Singaporean kids in fact almost babies as well a good start in life we have a strong social safety net with targeted assistance schemes so that those the difficulties are not left behind and forgotten and we intervene with extra help we ' re than education housing health care our jobs training for those who need it to enable them to take full advantage of the opportunities above all our education system must stay open we ' ve set aside places in primary schools for children without affiliation to these schools and we will do more of necessary we are expanding opportunities for students from different schools to interact through sports community activities and the outward - bound school last year I visited the outward - bound school for their 50th anniversary celebrations I had attended the course 50 years I chatted with Nicholas concezio who ' s the executive director of OBS and I told them that when I went to OBS 50 years ago as a 15 year old they only took in two students per secondary schools so in a group of hundred and thirty - odd there were people from 5060 different schools different language streams very different social backgrounds and we all had to get together because they mixed us up properly and we went to the course together we became good friends and came away understanding the diversity of our society better and how we could all work together because 17 days at that impressionable age it ' s an intense experience we are put through physically stressed you ' re emotionally put to your limits you have to work with others there ' s very little that you can do alone and we don ' t make friends you are miserable and you have to make friends across boundaries so I recounted this and Nicolas told me that today well because of the larger numbers they can ' t take in students from 60 or 70 schools at a time but they take in students from two or three schools at a time and nowadays the students all speak English but still he finds clear differences in their culture self and interests of the students from the different schools and even in the way they use language so is all speaking English but different interests different vocabulary really different world perspectives almost an obvious the students still learn to work in teams so when they pitch a tent or build a raft or safely belay someone on an obstacle course they must work closely with team mates you can ' t do it alone and so the students learn to bridge their differences and to trust one another so after 50 years OBS remains a valuable opportunity for students to mix an entire across different schools and social groups and we will do more of this so we ' re building an extension of OBS on Coney Island when that opens even more students will benefit from this experience so we are doing many things to improve social mobility but I have to be honest with you there are no easy solutions many societies have faced this problem many ideas have been proposed and tried out political philosophers statesmen all powerful human minds have been brought to bear to try to deal with this conundrum of how to keep your society spry open stable and there have been no magic bullets there have been varying degrees of success and the most successful models perhaps are the Scandinavian countries but even they have seen widening social inequality in recent times so we have to understand that this is what they call a wicked problem it ' s a problem with no easy solution which we will discuss rightly repeatedly in this house through the years our strategy in Singapore has been more successful than most with universal education with home ownership with the government ' s determination to widen opportunities and make the most of every citizen we ' ve made meritocracy work in Singapore and now that our society is more settled we must work harder to keep the pathways open and to level people up the government is not ideological we are pragmatic we will try anything which works we will learn from our own experience and the experience of others but we must also be realistic spot what looks promising but please also recognize what will not work some people have suggested I read in the newspapers a universal basic income which ins is a neat idea so far unproven anywhere in the world the Finns tried it and aborted the experiment early it didn ' t work for them others want to abolish the PSLE now that is in fact very hard to do educators have very different views and even parents have very different views whether it ' s PSLE you ' d be better off without the PSLE but we are taking the first steps to change the status quo by doing away with tea scores and if anyone can come up with a better alternative certainly we will consider in the end the government must focus on practical effective policies as a society we must uphold clear social norms that minimize social barriers and encourage mobility so as to keep our meritocratic system working well for all Singaporeans meritocracy is about individuals having opportunities and being successful but we must also be successful together as one people one society and one nation not just successful alone but successful together and that ' s what social cohesion is about we must feel a sense of social responsibility and concern for our fellow citizens without which our society cannot hold together what holds us together is not our pink n RI C ' s but the shared experiences that we build together over time we grew up together National Schools we are comfortable around each other regardless of our family backgrounds we go through national service building brotherhood and camaraderie when we march and fight together we eat at Hawker centers regardless whether we are rich and poor so the guidebook is wrong we live in HDB estates we learn the habits and preferences of different races and religions and we help neighbors out when they are in need we travel together on public transport and unlike in some other countries there ' s no social stigma to living in public housing or taking the bus or the train we celebrate our successes together such as sg50 recently and every national day and when crisis hit we go through them side by side we ' ve made much progress in our nation building we are now much more cohesive than 50 years ago when we didn ' t live in integrated HTTP States townships nor did we do ns together or even 20 years ago before 9 / 11 and before SARS but nation - building will always be a work in progress because the forces that pull Singaporeans in different directions never go away race language and religion are enduring fault lines from the start we knew they could divide and destroy us today our social cohesion has grown stronger but these tidal pools have grown stronger too take for example the influence of China and India on our own ethnic groups on Singaporean Indians and Chinese Singaporeans and Indian Singaporeans these are too vast nations even civilizations they are growing in strength and confidence it will be a very long time before we we become immune to their ethnic cultural or economic poles furthermore the relationship is complicated because on the one hand we want to maintain our separate identity as a multiracial sovereign independent country but on the other hand we want to say we speak Mandarin we have overseas Indians we have ethnic links we have cultural ties we have an inside track so between the two there ' s a tension and we have to keep that balance and maintain our position and our cohesion likewise with the Malays over time a Singapore and Malaya identity has emerged clearly but still it overlaps with the Malays in Malaysia both in terms of race as well as religion and the call for a global Ummah a community of the Muslims around the world has powerful appeal furthermore we are exposed in this Internet age to extremists and exclusivist teachings these can lead individuals are straight and if there ' s a terrorist attack it will cause great fear and distrust between Muslims and other Singaporeans beyond race language and religion we must work at building bridges between different groups and society in society traditionally when we talk about social cohesion we think of race language and religion but they be located in other dimensions there are other gradients other possible fault lines other ways where we have to strengthen our social cohesion and become closer together one of them is between unions and management another one is between all citizens and new the labor movement is one institution vital to our social cohesion because of the tripartite partnership labor - management relations are so source of strength for us unlike in many other countries where unions and management ' s are bitterly opposed whereas in Singapore labor harmony is secured with the help of a strong ntuc as we sing at every May Day rally slightly out of tune but in the new economy fewer workers are doing jobs traditionally covered by the trade unions and many more freelancers and professionals so these new groups are left out and union coverage shrinks as a result of the changing workforce composition and you have more people who are not represented not taken care of don ' t feel protected and look for other solutions it would weaken try part ISM and our social compact so it ' s better for the labour movement to embrace them to adopt their concerns to become more inclusive and that ' s what time to nsync did in until you see widening the labor movement membership beyond trade unions to include empty you see you associates the P Mets and the freelancers and now in teaming in an TOC will carry on his work another bridge we need to build is to our new citizens immigrants are part and parcel of our history and our identity and if you look ahead we need a steady flow of immigrants not too many not to feel just right to top up our population first - generation immigrants into any country will always take time to settle down to understand the nuances of the culture and character to progressively integrate into the society and that ' s what happens in the past with previous wait waves of first - generation Singaporeans over the last 200 years and that is a necessary process which has to happen as we continue to have an inflow of people to join us and become Singapore citizens the new arrivals have chosen to make Singapore their home and they will contribute to our country our society they have to make every effort to mix and to interact with everyone else for our part we should welcome them we should support them in their journey to become Singaporeans as others have helped our forefathers and help ourselves therefore there ' s much work to do to maintain our social cohesion mr . speaker sir these are the challenges for the next generation of leaders to continue to grow Singapore reinventing our economy creating new possibilities for the future to ensure that Singapore ' s always a land of opportunity a meritocratic fair and just society to hold Singaporeans together in one cohesive society can the next generation of leaders build on our shared experiences of 50 years and maintain the sense of collective mission can be worked to improve the lives of Singaporeans and not the lives of all Singaporeans and not the interests of nano groups so that they pass on an even stronger and more United Singapore I think they can the 4G team is now in place they ' re overseeing their own portfolios and projects they ' re explaining their ideas to Singaporeans they ' re implementing policies and making them work many of them joined in the last three general elections from 2006 onwards so but over the last 12 years I have also promoted promising backbenchers to become office holders including in a recent reshuffle it ' s a strong team of able men and women with a balanced combination of skills and strengths they are gaining experience they are willing to serve and most importantly their hearts in the right place we need new leaders for each generation from each generation because each generation has its own challenges to tackle and tough choices to make the electorate will be different the economic landscape will be different the international order may well also be different some hard truths will always remain for Singapore but even all problems may need new solutions we must be pragmatic and not ideological in our approach keep an open mind and make decisions both with the head and the heart remember our history but don ' t be trapped by it and that ' s why leadership renewal is crucial new ideas new bonds and new connections are needed with every new generation last week added reopening of Parliament I had a chance to chat with mr . Lou Tae Kyung somebody snapped a picture of us and the Workers Party posted a smiling photo of two of us on their Facebook page it was a nice picture what were we talking about I think mr . lo won ' t mind me sharing I asked him the Workers Party is having a leadership transition to what will change now that the wp has a new leader and he replied nothing much we the wp have our role these things should not change suddenly don ' t you agree I agreed with mr . Lou as an opposition party the Workers Party plays a role in our political system whoever is their party leader opposition parties keep Singapore politics contestable in other words the ruling party the PAP does not have a monopoly of power does not have the right to rule Singapore indefinitely so long as the PAP government performs it keeps a vote to support it stays in power and the opposition cannot gain ground but if the PAP government becomes incompetent or corrupt then of course the opposition will grow so our system gives the PAP government gives any government every incentive to perform and to keep the opposition performing its role where it is namely in the opposition the PAP is determined to perform we treat every election as a serious contest we take every debate in the house seriously and that ' s why we amended the Constitution to ensure that there will be always at least 12 opposition and NCM peace in the house whatever the outcome of the general election political parties do not have a fixed lifespan a time to live and a time to die as Ecclesiastes might put it how long a political party continues in government or in opposition for that matter because parties come and go in opposition to depends whether it can renew itself continue to serve the people continue to bring progress to the nation if the PAP can keep on successfully doing that we can stay in government but if we ever fail we deserve to lose so my message to all PAP end pieces work hard serve the people hold the ground win the elections this doesn ' t mean that government will shy away from difficult problems the government must government must govern and if ministers are not prepared to govern then give it up because that ' s your duty that ' s what you ' re here for and governing means that from time to time you have to do difficult things when they become necessary leadership means that you ' ve got to explain persuade convince people that you know what you are doing and that you are doing it for good reason and it ' s the right thing to do that ' s the way to maintain people ' s trust and Trust is crucial take taxes in the recent Malaysian election one hot issue was their GST the previous government had introduced the new GST tax three years ago and it had caused great unhappiness in Malaysia after Pakatan harapan won the election Dr Mahathir announced that his new government would abolish the GST why did this happen it wasn ' t because of the economic merits or demerits of the GST from the economic point of view the GST is better than the sales tax that it replaced but politically Malaysians linked the GST with other complaints they had with that with a previous government and they rejected the explanations and the persuasions and they said no I don ' t accept this I ' ll prove it does that mean that no government should ever raise taxes alas that ' s not the real world from time to time the country will need to spend more on health care on defense on education or something else and if revenues are not enough it will have no choice but to raise taxes then the government must convince the population that is raising taxes for a good reason for the right reason and whether the voters accept that will depend not just on the arguments but also crucially on whether they trust the government because when the arguments for every right argument you can produce five doubtful ones which look quite plausible and during elections there is no shortage of producers of such arguments and people can get confused finally they have to decide whom do they trust what is the track record do you want to put your future your fate your children ' s future in the hands of this team and believe that they have your best interests at heart and if you do you vote for them and you take all the things which need to be done as one bundle finally voters have to trust the government to do the right thing on their behalf even when it is painful I think this is the right lesson to learn without trust the government can ' t govern it wouldn ' t dare to do painful but necessary things and politics becomes the art of pandering a bidding war between the parties who can give more who can offer more you say you reduce the tax I say I abolish the tax then you say I will give you a home power on top of that and how to pay well we can think about that after the elections and the country goes downhill the 4G ministers understand this they ' ve been working together learning to complement one another strengths and weaknesses making decisions as a team and taking collective responsibility for these decisions to me this working together is as important if not more important than the question of who will be the next PM because for the next PM I know there ' s more than one qualified candidate we are fortunate that this is so because it provides strength and depth to the team now is about the team coming to a consensus on the best option but to work together as a team that is not a choice because there ' s no other option whoever becomes the next PM the team has to work closely together for him to succeed and if they cannot or do not do so then the next PM will fail whoever he is even in the best of times and certainly in times of severe crisis mr . Lee Kuan Yew did not run the country by himself neither did mr . Goh chok Tong nor myself when mr . Lee one year Wassily received the freedom of the City of London in 1982 it was a grand occasion they dressed up he made a speech he said I feel like a conductor at a concert bowing to applause but unable to turn around and invite the accomplished musicians in his orchestra to rise and receive the ovation for the music they have played for running a government is not unlike running an orchestra and no Prime Minister ever achieves much without an able team of players I think I can speak for mr . mr . Goh chok Tom when I say that we both feel the same way all three of us were not sole leaders but Primus inter pares that means first amongst equals by the emphasis is we are equals but you ' re just the first amongst equals first amongst equals with our colleagues we take their views we take them seriously we benefit from their advice and their abilities and their skills we have fierce arguments as to what to do but we are honest strong on a team together with strong enough bonds that we can deal with issues together and there ' s leadership but it is unforced it has to be unforced leadership the team accepts respects and knows that it has an important role to play they are not there just to carry out orders we were all fortunate Singapore was fortunate that the PM ' s had such tall with colleagues mostly had a core team very strong ministers supporting him coking Suez Rajaratnam Lim Kim san juan ' s riesen Osman wok ESM go had a talented team to haunting Joe Tony Tan one can say Akuma Donna Balin Abdul Atta Mooji Giorgio just to name a few if anything yes M ghost team was even more comprehensive than mr . Lee ' s and when I took over as Prime Minister I inherited ESM goes strong team and mr . Goel himself stayed on and we added talent to his team now he stepped down I rely on my own core team which now also includes several of the four G ministers so the next PM must have and will have his own star WA colleagues to his generation and I hope also younger ones I know everyone is anxious to know who the next PM will be well the leader must command the respect and loyalty of his whole team he must enjoy the support and confidence of the broad mass of Singaporeans and these things take time they cannot be false I do not believe we are ready to settle on a choice yet nor is it helpful to treat this either as a horse race or campaign to lobby support for one or the other candidate this is a team game we want a strong cohesive team so that team Singapore is the winner I have just reassured the cabinet I have moved some ministers to new portfolios I ' ve expanded the responsibilities of others the 4G ministers now helm two thirds of the ministries we have a major say in policies and the direction to take Singapore let ' s give them the time and space to do their own work to work together in their new roles and to get better known by the public I ' m confident that in the fullness of time we will see a clear outcome and a leader will emerge from the process certainly I expect this to happen before the next general election for these 14 years SPM I have been working with a 4G team guiding them assessing them preparing them to take over the reins when Hanks recap rounded up the budget debate this year I was happy to hear him describe the budget as one that not only meets the needs of today ' s generation but also accounts for the needs of future generations it showed that the 4G ministers understood that their deepest responsibility is to be a steward of Singapore what does it mean steward the government is certainly not the owner of Singapore but neither is it just the manager of Singapore it is the steward it ' s responsible for taking good care of the country for holding it in trust building up and handing it on in due time to future generations the government must keep faith with past generations who gifted this country to us it has to be responsible to the present generation who continue to build on what we have inherited but above all it must consider future generations whose lives and whose futures depend on us on us the present generation depend on us thinking of their interests acting on their behalf making wise and farsighted decisions to cause Singapore to endure and to flourish for many more years I ' m confident that when the time comes for me to hand over to a new prime minister Singapore will be put into the hands of good stewards we ' ve built something truly special here in Singapore countries near and far look to Singapore is a model of governance and development people who want to live here do business here even the US and the DPRK are planning to hold their meeting here in many other countries political leaders plan only up to the next election or the next crisis but in Singapore we are able to think beyond the immediate beyond ourselves we care about our community our country and our future our religious leaders they visit temples churches mosques together they give blessings on one another ' s milestone celebrations our neighbors and friends invite us over for makan during Chinese New Year Deepavali or Hari Raya our youth travel and experience the world they come back eager to apply what they have seen and learnt around the world back home our grandparents and our parents bring us up and nurture us they are living examples of how by working hard we can build better lives for ourselves and our children so we are all living the Singapore story keeping it alive we must sustain and pass on this shared vision of prospering together progressing together that way we will make this little red dot shine bright in the world as well as in our hearts for many many years to come Thank You mr . speaker mr .

Kumar pointed out we inherited section 377 a from the British from imported from the English Victorian law Victorian from the period of Queen Victoria in the 19th century by the Indian Penal Code by the Strait settlement penal code into Singapore law Asian societies don ' t have such laws not in Japan not in China not in Taiwan but it ' s part of our landscape we ' ve retained it over the years so the question is what do we want to do about it now do we want to do anything about it now if we retain it we ' re not enforcing it proactively nobody has argued for it to be enforced very vigorously in this house if we abolish it we may be sending the wrong signal that our circumstance has changed and the rules have shifted but because of the Penal Code amendments section 377 a has become a symbolic issue the the point for both opponents and proponents to tussle around the gay activists wants it removed those who are against gay values and lifestyle argue strongly to retain it and both sides have mobilized to campaign for their causes there was a petition to remove section 377 a it accumulated couple of thousand signatures which and was presented in this house then therefore there was a counter - petition to retain it which collected 15 , 000 signatures at least 22 newspapers I have encountered the signatures 15 , 000 15 5 6 0 signatures probably gone up since last we started speaking also with an open letter to me and the ministers and I we have received many emails and letters on this subject and I ' ve received the emails too in my mailbox very well written all following a certain model answer style so it ' s a very well - organized campaign and not only writing letters but people constituents have visited MPs and meet the people sessions to see the MP not because there ' s anything they want done but to congratulate the empty on what a good government this is that we are keeping section 377 a and please stay a good government and please don ' t change it so I don ' t doubt the depth of the sentiments and the breadth of the support but it ' s also a very well organised pressure campaign but I ' m not surprised that this issue is too contentious because even in the West even where they have liberalized homosexuality still remains a very contentious issue the decriminalized homosexual behave as decades ago in the 1960s 70s and they ' ve gone a long way towards accepting gays in society they don ' t really have gays in a prominent places it ' s if you want to have a complete cabinet or complete lineup when you go for elections you must have some on your list so that you are seem to have been inclusive certainly so in Europe also through in America but still the issue is bitterly disputed so in America there are fierce debates over gay rights and same - sex marriages and the Conservatives in America are pushing back so President George Bush has been calling for constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman and not between a man and a man or a woman and a woman this is an America so the issue is still joined even within the churches it ' s a hot subject the Anglican Church Church of England the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams he had gave you he had liberal views on gay issues he became the archbishop he has moderated his views because he has a reflected Church as a whole and even within the church the church in England the church in America have a very serious disagreement with a church of with the Anglican churches in Asia and in Africa who almost split away on this issue of ordination of gay people as bishops and they ' ve patched up a compromise recently in America and the Archbishop of Canterbury who ' s head of the church had to plead with his with a community to come to some understanding so that they maintain the Anglican Communion so this is not an issue where we can reach happy consensus and abolishing section 3 7 sir\"]\n",

      "[\"and not sure whether our neighborhoods are as you say they are you know I work with that people at the bottom of the scale and we see quite a different picture to the picture you ' ve been painting and I think we also need to talk about how whether or not median income is a good measure what ' s going on you know we have people in your party who are earning in the millions of dollars and I had my lunch at the beach road Hawker Center there ' s a 71 year old Hawker who is earning six hundred and fifty dollars a month your party earns less than your ministers are less than that in a day so we must not look purely at what ' s happening at the median but we have to drill down to the individual voters whom we are here to serve rather than just to lead because it ' s always the hard way that is projected to the world but the software that we are into but the lower low end of our low income which we should be addressing and it will take up like now if you go into healthcare it ' s actually going into the Japanese kind of era where you know Japanese by 2055 you will have the facing the silver population 1 1 point 2 is to 1 to 2 to to take care of the other to the elderly well this is where we should have focused on some measures on health care today so this is this is a long term thank you just a few more seconds left I think what I want to say is that change can the PAP guarantee that it will continue on their track record record for the next 30 years is that safe to put all our eggs into one basket without an alternative Lina well I should put you in one will let my husband use the power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely so I think that we should have more option members of parliament okay well I ' m afraid we have run out of time for this segment of the discussion mr . Tom and I believe that that Gerald threw you a question would you like to respond before we move on to the next segment I think the one thing that makes us different from most of the countries is that the ruling party the PAP is a party that cares for the average Singaporean and the lower - income Singaporean no other society that comes close where 85 % of those in the bottom 20 % of our society own their homes and where the bottom 20 % of society receives a very substantial transfer benefits every year far more than the taxes they pay we have one of the most progressive tax systems in the world and certainly amongst developed countries so this is a government that cares for not just those at the top those in the upper middle income group those at the bottom the individual hawker the individual cleaner the individual production worker that ' s our brand of government that ' s the way we will continue to run this place to the point about poor people I think in any society no matter how well we do there will always be a segment who are trying to catch up I think the important question is that what are we doing to help them rather than just talking about them I mean if you look at the efforts that we have occurred over the last few years some are very encouraging we talk about workers who are stuck in jobs that don ' t pay very well we have the inclusive growth program we work hard with companies on board they are already at least 200 and through the efforts of the inclusive growth programme 20 , 000 workers will benefit and I think that these efforts are what will really make a difference to the lives of Norwich workers instead of us just talking about them let ' s put our efforts into really helping them through these very difficult but ultimately successful and effective measures okay well thank you thank you for viewing it go for break when we return we will discuss two hot - button issues the cost of living and foreign workers stay tuned and welcome back to the program in this segment which will adopt the discussion format we will explore the more immediate issues facing Singapore media corpse Today newspaper commissioned a survey recently and out of more than 600 people polled one in two say the rising cost of living is more likely to influence how they cast their ballot compared to other hot - button issues such as housing and foreigners so let ' s kick off this segment by asking the opposition why the cost of living is the hottest of issues and we ' ll get the finance minister to respond to the issues raised who like to start you know during our house visits I have to agree with that survey because during our house visits and women when you talk to residents cost of living definitely is biggest the biggest issue that they have and we feel that very often the rhetoric that we hear from the government is that all cost of living is beyond our control because we are such a small country and we are influenced by external factors but we believe that lots of levers that the government has to control the cost of living and I think there ' s a lot more that the government can do control what lever does your party have okay firstly the the government has has the levers to control it things like HDB prices that contributed to a large part to people ' s cost of living we one of the proposals we have is that the cost of the HDB flats should be pegged to the median incomes of the Singaporeans who are eligible to buy HDB flats it should not be pegged to the market and with the market subsidy that what the government calls it things like rentals all are affected to a great extent by by they contribute to the cost of doing business and that contributes to to people having to pay more for their goods and services Lina SPPs use but I think the open - door immigration has a lot to play with it because we are trying to get in as many immigrants as I mean our citizens as much of it I think they say that I want to be about six million if I ' m wrong I correct me if I ' m wrong and I think that this put a constraint or the cost of living housing medical transport school and Roman and etc etc and I believe that we should look carefully to see whether we should do we need to have that amount of population in Singapore because it ' s land constraint and we don ' t have hinterland yeah but let ' s just stick to the issue of the cost of living I ' m I would like to move now to yes and I said can I hit carry on again a quick point so living is maybe the privatization of over in markets also eat the cost of living because I know what Marcus you know you people can buy cheaper goods but now with the privatization of all these red markets I think it ' s more expensive to buy then certain SDT self cost of living well I ' m not surprised that that ' s a key issue because you know it ' s getting impossible to live in Singapore we are one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in and I don ' t think that ' s an accidental thing I agree with Jarrell that it ' s government has a you know that ' s part of what government is there to do to ensure that people can live well we we have to remember the universe inflation is significantly higher at the moment higher than the government self is issuing alarm bells sounding alarm bells about it other costs that we have that are also rising healthcare costs I know a taxi driver who I was in his cab when he said he couldn ' t afford a cataract operation because of the exorbitant costs yesterday in the Straits Times there was an article about a young woman who went to for a specialist appointment via the polyclinic so a public patient and she was given a three - month waiting period and she was told by that hospital and she asked three other hospitals who also said to her that if you went as a private patient the waiting time is reduced to three minutes and the difference in price is 25 for a polyclinic and 17 what ' s one thing your party might propose to mitigate well you ' re saying initially zero rate GST for basic services GST as a consumption text everybody who studies these matters knows that the GSD a consumption tax is one of the most inequitable taxes you can ever devised because the rich and the poor have to buy the same amounts of rice and bread and oil and sugar so we say zero rate GST for basic products and have a great data GST all the way up to luxury items we also say that the HDB housing system should be run as a non - profit that ' s been brought up already by Jerrold nothing not to say my question will be the forwards have agreed to Stillman sitting the high cost of living what should be the factor will be the housing high cost per house the healthcare education even in fact and also some essential items which I think be zero GST policy should be should be there then getting generous plastic on housing I think the housing issue is very very busy here so like I say a public issue should be a public issue but then commercial issue so I think the ministry or the ministry itself have put this public issue into a commercial platform so it becomes a demand and supply issue so if I won ' t go into statistic if the rental flats at now which is less then the supply addendum the demand the queues are so long but then again we have we are having few block I mean many blocks of flat which is read driven and privatize to be rental s private and the fair why not push it can I make one very question you go to thumb and I just wanted to say thumb and ended the previous segment by saying that 85 % of Singaporeans own their own homes now this also is cognizant of the low income this is also because they ' re causing significant struggles because these are people who have used their entire savings for the CPF to pay for their own homes and they arrived at their pensions poor that ' s why we have people who are having to work into their 70s and 80s collecting a cardboard and tin cans because they have spent all their money on their house so we are a set secure but income insecure in Singapore precisely for the low income group ok we have just a quick a little while for for Josephine to respond a little and then we ' ll get to a new story well in my past five years as an MP I see residents every Tuesday evening and the concern over medical care I think of course has to be looked in the context of whether we are able to put in place a social safety net to help those who really need it and I can say for a fact that over that ' s five years there ' s not been one single person who was denied quality medical care because he could not afford it we have a meta file system in place if they are in need they can go and look for the medical social worker and they were okay with that we need to end this discussion part of the segment of Minister which had to respond to all the views that represented sulfa including Josephine ' s first the cost of new houses for first - time buyers is about 23 % of incomes the cost of servicing be the flat that hasn ' t changed very much over time and it ' s significantly lower than Hong Kong and most other cities significantly lower than in fact the developed countries at large it is cheaper to own and serviced the mortgage on a house in Singapore than it is in any other developed country that ' s point one Josephine has mentioned medical costs our medifund scheme which is for the lowest income group those who are too poor to create the bills is being expanded so if you take medifund together with Medisave and then the Insurance Scheme MediShield we ensure that everyone will be able to get quality health care at an affordable cost and that ' s what all the international reviews recognises that Singapore delivers value for money in health care if you look at cities what really distinguishes Singapore because all cities are expensive what really distinguishes Singapore is that the middle end and the lower end of our society gets significant benefits from the government each year significantly more than the GST they peel and that ' s the whole idea of the GST the bulk of the GST is collected from the top forty percent of the population and foreigners and my new foreigners contribute a lot of GST and we use the benefits to help those at the lower end so if you talk about exempting food or any other essentials from GST you ' re really taking away a source of revenue we are getting made mainly from those at the upper end and foreigners and reducing our ability to help those at the low end so let ' s be straight low - income Singaporeans receive from the government each year far more than the amount they pay in GST they receive it through welfare they receive it - you save subsidies they receive it through extra bursaries from pre - school all the way up to university so we have to leave the issue of a cost of living there we need to move on to the next issue that of foreign workers which has already come up in parts now according to the same poll commissioned by today 7 in 10 voters are concerned with increased competition with foreigners for jobs for nearly 8 in 10 say the congestion on public transport is a concern so Lina you start up just now talking about cost of living with about the open immigration policy so I gather the foreigners the issue of foreigners would be an issue close to the heart of your party yes would you like to add to this well they shall foreigners in Singapore what does your party propose to do about the situation of immigration as when it comes to foreign workers that ' s how they ' d be given that Singapore does need an amount of labour from outside Singapore but your party views that the open immigration policy is perhaps detrimental or harming Singapore yes it is harmful to Singapore because they take away our jobs you know in areas of job creation I think there should be a level playing field where you know there are this p . m . ETS you know can hold the data with s pass they can come in and they no need to pay CPF Soleri and whatever party proposed to do instead or my party proposed that or the government should set some sort of policy or some law to ensure that our workers get a job from the owners you were the government what would your party do well we meet that you meet the employers who are paying this this workers from foreign countries to top up the the salary of the our local Singaporeans because they save a lot on the you know the CPF\"]\n",

to - house visits to deliver foodstuffs to the needy just to sidetrack this was actually when I had my first political awakening because when I visited a house I was surprised to see that there was an old lady who was she had a roof over her head but she didn ' t even have enough money to buy a meal and then angered me because yes we have provided food for her for that one day but what is going to happen to her the rest of the days and that was when I realized that you need policies to go down to the root of the matter and you cannot rely on organizations to do the job for you okay moving on so after that I went to junior college and you know I was always very actively involved in CCS I was in the secondary school band after that I continued with my van activities in junior college when I moved on to university I decided to take on a more nurturing role so what I did was I continued doing camp counseling because I believe that ' s the best way to integrate students into the community on top of that I also had an online publication in NUS there was independent of any stakeholders so this was called the campus observer I fronted a as the managing editor and from there I explored issues that were pertinent to the ground in NUS many people have questioned whether youth is liability in politics I like to disagree I feel that in politics you need a representation of different types of voices in Parliament you need to ensure that there is a diverse and well around the group of individuals who are coming together to speak on behalf of national interests so with that I would say that you know I want to stand up here at the candidate and I want to represent the voice the voices of young Singaporeans who feel that they want to stay in this country who want to have their voice heard but who have been epithet ik all this while because they feel powerless to make any real change and I want to change that I want to engage young Singaporeans in politics and policymaking it ' s not our intention right Murray parade we had the party as a whole as a higher level have been always interested in Manipuri for strategic reasons here as he is there walking the ground in McPherson for the past two years and so he really has a very intimate understanding of the ground and you will be ashamed if we were to let this GRC go uncontested the way it has for the past 20 years for me personally Murray period holds a lot of sentimental value because I spent most of my education there in thi jail in t KS s follow by BJC so I feel very there ' s a strong draw to the environment to the GRC itself and I hope to offer my Canada to the residents to show that I ' m familiar with that concept and it needs okay oh that might say thank you I will address this question the title is meant as a personal account and I ' m quite surprised to see that people are actually so keen to grand exam that they will dig up a post that is really very very old because I ' ve seen a particular tweet for myself and it ' s something to do in congested traffic no if the traffic has been like at a standstill for an hour and you are running late for meeting wouldn ' t you be sorry - no I can see yes I ' m from a middle - class family okay I say in affirmation b - flat so if that ' s down to income I eat at a coffee shop every day because that ' s the cheapest thing that I can afford I mean once you know why I do I ' ll go on my friends be a nicer places but you know I think with regards to being on the ground I understand how the average Singaporean feels because I myself I feel that I ' m an average Singaporean I ' m not elite I do not have you know a scholar I I don ' t know a scholarship background I was never like um I never met University overseas so I think with regards to the contents of the everyday Singaporean I understand how I feel I understand how it feels to send in a crowded train I understand how it feels to you know be stuck in congested traffic and or refer to my tweet yeah so I think yeah I do empathize I do empathize I think that politics in general is quite a tricky game especially for the opposition but one thing I ' m very thankful for and I ' m very thankful for and I think that you know it ' s important to have is a strong support system so our friends our families are from all the people who are rallying behind me online I think one thing I ' m thankful for I said I ' ve been raised in a culture that has always taught me to push the boundaries and to question the status quo so I think part of it led to me questioning the current state of policies you know yes they benefit Singaporeans as a whole but what about those who fall through the cracks it ' s a not being done for them and I think yeah I ' ve very supportive parents yeah while you guys really recycling your questions okay I think that ' s a very tricky question to us a 24 year old I ' m only 24 I cannot say that I ' ve had a regret that it ' s so life - threatening they had stopped me in my tracks and made me unable to move forward so yes I would say that I have had many setbacks in life perhaps a few minor regrets here and there but I think as a whole every triumph every regret every telling you shed every part that you ' ve chosen to take has developed you or rather developed me as a person okay my biggest strength I would say is that I ' m very driven in a very committed and I ' m very energetic so whenever I ' m committed to a cause I see true and I have a very strong sense of justice so if I feel that there are people who are being treated unfairly if I feel that it has been an unfair distribution of resources I will want to be in there to step in and to be the doer you know to change things in stuff standing by the sidelines and complaining but we forgot to my weakness you know that could also translate to my weakness because I can get very very emotional about that so I don ' t think yeah I know I need to control their life then and that ' s it I ' m also a professional eater sometimes so for those of you on my Facebook page if I have a reply to your comment I ' m so sorry I will do it very soon I do not wish to compare myself to her I do not wish to focus on issues of trivial importance and I think that it ' s important that we focus on the pressing national issues at hand that will impact how voters make the decision in the coming elections\"]\n",

Haines believes society cannot afford to breed and us - versus - them mentality he says a caring society and rugged individuals must go hand in hand and called on Singaporeans to give back to the broader society and not forget who they owe their success to an excessive focus on the individual his rights his needs his ones his aspirations his achievements more ultimately be detrimental both to the individual as well as to society such a person is self - absorbed and self - centered he attributes his achievements to his own brilliance or diligence that has promote a spirit of giving and make voluntarism philanthropy corporate social responsibility and social enterprises a way of life a part of the Singaporean DNA the price and supply of rice will remain stable despite the severe floods in Thailand Minister of State for Trade and Industry Lian says most of Thailand ' s rice fields were not affected by floodwaters and the presence of alternative sources and Singapore ' s small import volume means rice can easily be purchased from other countries like India responding to a question from MP for West Coast GRC foo mija mr . Li said while Singapore has no control over global prices the government has in place several measures to mitigate sharp price spikes and supply disruptions there is no panic in the market because this industry of supply has got many buffers in each of the supply chain so for instance we have our own stock power other countries do and even a supply themselves or the intermediary themselves keep you know a healthy stock level in terms of supply law and Foreign Affairs Minister K Shanmugam says the case involving two Singaporean women who were made to do nude squats when at a johor detention centre would have to be resolved in accordance with Malaysian laws mr . Shanmugam who was replying to a question in Parliament about the case acknowledged the concerns Singaporeans have over the treatment of the two women he says on 9th September the Malaysian High Commission in Singapore informed his ministry that a thorough investigation of the case had been completed but a report has yet to be finalised but he gave the assurance that his ministry will continue to press them for the official investigation report for this incident should not have an impact on the overall bilateral relationships between Malaysia and Singapore I will take this opportunity to remind Singaporeans traveling to Malaysia and in particular those traveling to jeho by row to always check and ensure that their passports are stand at entry and exit by the Malaysian immigration authorities the National Council on problem gambling is expanding its services to include not just counselling but also financial and credit services in an update to Parliament today acting Community Development Minister chanchan Singh said his ministry is monitoring casino advertisements to ensure they do not glamorous gaming latest figures show that as of 30th September 29 thousand people have applied to ban themselves from the two casinos up from 18 , 000 as of June and between January and August nearly 570 gamblers sought help for their addictions nearly double the number from 2008 we are concerned with this issue with or without the casinos because even before the event of the casinos we already have 1 to 2 percent in terms of pathological or problem gambling we what we watch this very closely and we want to continue to ensure that we have a situation that we can manage on our hands but the Home Affairs Ministry says it ' s still too early to tell if there is a link between the opening of the two casinos and trends in unlicensed money - lending but the second Minister for Home Affairs SS Warren says the government is tracking this closely mrs . Warren says unlicensed money lending and harassment reports dropped by more than 20 % in the first nine months of this year compared to the same period last year and this can be attributed to tougher laws and stepped up police enforcement mrs . Warren says there is also a comprehensive effort to educate children who may be used by loan sharks in their activities most of the time they are involved in the distribution of things like name cards pamphlets and flyers advertising easy loans for loan sharks they were generally ignorant of the environment and illegal activity and were enticed by the opportunity to make easy money I think notwithstanding that we need to send a strong message to the youth first of all that there are serious consequences to be involved in such activity turning to the elderly the Ministry of Community Development Youth and Sports says more can be done to enhance home - based care for them an integrated home care model has been piloted to serve this group with multiple care needs and cya says it also recognizes the importance of training foreign domestic workers to help families cope with the demands of caregiving MC why is that M who is currently studying the provision of home - based social and health care needs for elderly with a view to promoting Aging in Place right citing of care and a more seamless transition from the hospitals to the community and the home health minister Gong Kim Young says working Singaporeans withdrew some 130 million dollars from their Medisave accounts last year to pay for their parents health care expenses he says this is 18 percent of the total amount withdrawn from Medisave accounts in 2010 replying to a question from nan constituency MP Gerald Giam mr . GaN says while the government will do its best to provide assistance to those who need it most individuals also have to play their part in staying healthy at the individual level each one of us must take personal responsibility for our health and we also have to take our personal responsibility to save up for rainy days in case one day we ' ll fall ill mutual support in the family will provide a second line of defense and this is part and parcel of our family values and MP 4 Marine Parade GRC tin paling made her maiden speech appealing for help for both the old and the young miss tin has urged the government to consider providing free basic health care to elderly Singaporeans in the public health care setting she said elderly issues are close to her heart as one in three residents in her McPherson Ward are aged over 50 years on the youth miss teen says while young people know that earlier generations have done a lot of good for Singapore they also want to forge their own paths ahead the government and society need not overreact to the loud and sometimes strident debate especially on the Internet sure there should be guiding principles and even a code of conduct but robust debates or even disagreements on issues shows that young Singaporean are genuinely concerned about the future of Singapore our Singapore we should let things take their natural course young people will gradually figure out for ourselves the way forward by trying up new ideas and working out which sacred house can be slayed and ultimately pushing out the boundaries of what Singapore can become by early next year the average waiting time for a child to be enrolled into an early intervention center will be halved from 6 months to 3 the Ministry of Community Development Youth and Sports has expanded capacity and it ' s 14 early intervention centers it will also be opening more centers and hiring more staff the number of preschool children diagnosed with disabilities and developmental delays has almost doubled in the past five years from a thousand three hundred and 2005 to 2 , 500 in 2010 in recent years there has been increasing awareness amongst parents on disability and developmental delays at the same time the MOH Child Development Program or CDP for short has enhanced their capability and capacity on detection and analysis at a younger age together these factors have contributed to more children and younger children seeking intervention services our mo kio GRC MP doctor in town Asura Mokhtar says more can be done to redistribute resources to neighborhood schools particularly to normal technical classes she urged the Ministry of Education to ensure that those teaching normal technical students in mainstream schools be specially trained in areas such as motivational and counseling skills relating her experience and feedback from other teachers doctor in turn said teachers of normal technical students are usually overwhelmed by the amount and skill required of them I hope that normal technical classes and mainstream schools can be made somewhat smaller more specially trained teachers can be deployed to these classes while more relevant courses and programs such as computer graphic animation or digital music for instance can be introduced to them so that we can maximize the potential during the school years this is pretty much like what we did for the gifted education program back then if you could do it for the top - end of the academy extreme why not for the other end replying senior parliamentary secretary for education Hiwassee diapie says the ministry has already been doing more for normal technical students he said there will soon be two more new specialized schools for these students in calculating teacher quota for example we have considered we give consideration to schools with more normal cost students by providing additional manpower grants and an additional head of department 4nt for schools with larger normal technical enrolment in tandem with curriculum demands we have provided more teachers - for example subjects such as computer application design and technology which require process provision are taught in groups of 20 and women was the focus of senior minister of state graceful speech she urged the government to rethink policies for single mothers and mothers who want to re - enter the workforce she noted that many hesitate to go back to work due to the lack of confidence or relevant skills we need companies to offer transition arrangement such as part - time work internship for mature workers perhaps to help transit woman into the fast paced job that they were used to job matching programs targeted specifically at women should be encouraged Parliament has been adjourned to a date to be fixed good night\"]\n",
      "[\"a lot of people say can we have a two - party system that ' s the ideal that ' s how many developed countries work that ' s what you should aim for a change of government from team the first party to the second and then from the second to come back and then you are considered to have matriculated but how could this happen in Singapore that we have two parties I can imagine several scenarios first the society splits based on race or religion you have one party representing one race or religion another party representing another race or religion that ' s the worst possible scenario for Singapore and we ' ve done our best to make sure that it never comes about because if you are split on race on religion you ' re not just going to have political quarrels they are going to divide the society and that ' s the end for Singapore your second possibility is that you divided on class lines we don ' t get our economy economic policies right or maybe just the world trends are such the rich get richer the poor don ' t make progress after a while the poor lose hope in the system the rich lose interest in the rest of society and they say that so one side says text me less let me keep my wealth the other side says give me more transfer more welfare more goodies more benefits and you have two parties forming one representing one group the other one representing the other group rich and poor I think we should try the maximum extent that we can align all the interest of Singaporeans and make sure that one party can represent you whether you are the CEO or whether you ' re the taxi driver the third possibility is that we split on policy grounds you argue that this set of policies will be best for Singapore to grow promoting mncs they argue that no I don ' t want MMC sending them all the way and depending on Singaporeans and Singapore companies is a way to grow and we can ' t reconcile and we split and we over the policies and fight it out in the polls I think is that could happen but it ' s not so likely because the PAP is a pragmatic party and we are ready to take in good ideas but the most important reason why a two - party system is not workable is because we don ' t have enough talent in Singapore to form to a teams to form to really first - class teams to govern Singapore really well more than any other country singapore needs exceptionally able leadership to tackle challenges and to minimize the risks for our country where small we are vulnerable with a mediocre government other countries may muddle through and have to muddle through but singapore will fail the most effective way to get a two - party system if you really want to do it is to split the PAP into because the talent is there is gathered we will have two persons I choose one you choose one I choose one you choose one okay now we have two teams now we play toss the coins we seriously considered making the PAP two parties not that way but in principle but we didn ' t do it because we couldn ' t solve one problem how can you make two teams each one as good as the original one team which we had which took really what would have been the best players from both teams or to put it in very hard and direct tangible terms where can you find to finance ministers and to defense ministers I have one finance minister and one defense minister if you have a spare one somewhere please let me know why do I choose these two because these are two of the most difficult jobs in the cabinet to film in finance you have to make judgments on taxes affecting all Singaporeans on expenditures affecting all ministries on the budget they ' re talking about 50 billion dollars of expenditure every year as well as on our reserves gic Thomas a mes and others adding up to more than 100 billion u . s . dollars to find one of them is not easy to find two of them you must really your baby is the same as defense in a curiously opposite way because finances about money and is very difficult and defense is very difficult because it is not about money because the bottom line is intangible security risk threats judgment what is worth spending on what is worth investing on which is the right aeroplane to buy how many ships do you need which kernels to make general how to shape the SEF which threats are getting serious when do I recommend to mobilize the SAF when do I decide I must deploy and defend can you easily find anybody off the street to do that sort of job very very difficult so therefore I think one team get the best people together fill each job with the best man if we split into two teams then whichever one is in charge the government is going to be weaker and the chances of something going wrong will go up definitely even if things don ' t go wrong standards will go down and that ' s why I and all my predecessors have gone out of our way to skul the land for talent to join the team and every election we have 20 odd candidates become new MPs and out of these on average i did account over the last five or six elections about three make it to become minister but we have 14 ministries to fill and then on top of that you need some supervising ministers and DPMS I ' m senior missus ministers because you need some additional experience than oversight of the systems of the system so just just say fourteen ministries to Phil and I can get three new ministers each term you do the math 14 / 3 means on average each Minister has reserved at least four terms the opposition parties pitch themselves as offering Singapore fall back should the PAP fail it sounds plausible but if you think about it what does it depend on most critically it comes back to talent again if the PAP can ' t assemble a second team I don ' t think the opposition will find it easier to do that you look at it from the micro view consider a capable person weighing his options trying he wants to serve the nation he ' s trying to decide how to do it which way he should go and he has two choices first choice join the opposition oversee the pap but really spend his life and can be quite a long time waiting and watching just in case they ' re PAP screws up then he ' ll be ready to take over the other alternative is joined the government help it to make better decisions implement good policies and avoid making mistakes and screwing up now which makes more sense for him and for Singapore so I think for all these reasons I think the best thing for us to do is to concentrate our resources and form one really strong Singapore team some people who want to join the opposition yes we want to propound alternative policies or they want to be a check on the government that ' s valid by all means join the opposition especially if the government is wrong or incompetent but so long as the government is competent and doing a good job for Singaporeans I hope you make common cause with it and help us to ensure that things stay right but what we can do and must do to assure Singapore ' s future is to develop the strongest possible 18 with depth and resilience competent ministers people with expertise in different ministries plus depth younger ones learning the job so that as the situation changes as we have new needs we can always find the right person for the right job and if one person doesn ' t work out I can do a replacement I can call a timeout change my team member and the game goes on actually that ' s how soccer is played if you watch world cup soccer every country only has one team no country feels two teams for the World Cup soccer you have one national soccer team you have reserves players you have coaches you can change players and if need be you can even change the coach but you concentrate all your talent make one team and give it your best shot whether it ' s Johannesburg all rio de janeiro and i think that ' s what we should do we are not so successful in soccer but we are not doing badly in government and I think that we should keep up our winning streak and stay in the championship league in the international contest of Nations\"]\n",

      "[\"Aaron speaker relief siblings have stated that their big brother has misused his position and influence over government agencies to drive his personal agenda and that they fear the use of organs of state against them these are serious charges and deeply troubling but to be fair to the Prime Minister are the allegations or rages are they merely a figment of the least siblings overactive imagination we in this house will not be able to get down to the bottom of these questions during this debate for one simple reason there is no natural justice in the procedure adopted but due respect to the Prime Minister we ' re only hearing the PM ' s version the government ' s version today what else there is we do not know in ghee delegations have been made today that the Lisa Billings have been selectively in the documentation and may not have been truthful they are not here to defend themselves I am not accusing the Prime Minister ' s life I ' m simply stating what we all know that we simply do not have full information to confidently decide on who and what to believe notwithstanding the limited value of this session I wish to raise one matter that should be of concern to every Singaporean wishes to see Singapore as a bastion that upholds the rule of law and that is how fundamentally precious it is that we defend with all our hearts and minds the independence of our organs of state we must protect the organs of state as professional bodies with a national mission the government should never seek to interfere with or to influence those organs of state setup to ensure good governance for instance click the Auditor General ' s office da geo is an organ of state the Adriel prides itself in its core values of Independence and integrity in elaborating on its independence the Eijiro states that it carries out its audits without fear or favour in explaining its integrity the age your pleasures to strive to uphold the public trials in its work such a lofty mission is fleshed out in the agios annual reports which document publicly the financial management shortcomings of the ministries and the PMO the significant contribution of the ATO towards good governance and public accountability is clear to all of us I now turn to another organ of state the Attorney General ' s chambers according to the AGC website the AGC recognizes that and I quote as principal legal adviser to the government the Attorney General plays an important role in upholding the rule of law in Singapore and thus contributes to one of the key aspirations of her people to build a democratic society based on the fundamental ideals of justice and equality unquote madam make no mistake the AG is a fiercely powerful state actor more powerful than all judges when judges decide cases they are constrained by the laws passed by Parliament and their decisions are public and appealable by contrast the AG as the public prosecutor has almost absolute prosecutorial discretion he can decide not to charge a person who has committed an offense to let an offender offer the warning to reduce charges and so on these decisions are most gritty yes they are not public and not appealable it is not an exaggeration to say that all of us are the mercy of the AG but each of us should be fairly treated by him since under the Constitution all of us are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law even though the Attorney General is constitutionally a member of the executive he is expected to work independently it is stated in the AGC website that the AG his role as public prosecutor and I quote is vested with the power to Institute conduct or discontinue proceedings for any offence the Attorney General is independent in this role and not subject to the control of the god unquote these are the agency ' s own words Indy cars law ministers had expressly endorsed the need for there to be distance between the government and the AGC for instance professor STR Kumar recently gave an interview for a book marking a GCS 150th anniversary fair he recalled how when he was appointed Minister of State for law in 1981 he was given an office located at the AGC then in high street professor Derrick uma then be counted as follows and I quote I told the then Attorney General tan Boon dick that it was not proper for a Minister of State for law to be housed in the AGC because it would raise all sorts of questions about the agency ' s autonomy unquote fast forward to today in Prior debates this year I had raised questions about the appointment of the current AG and his newest deputy AG the role of the newest deputy AG as an immediate past MP is well known as for the AG it was also well known that he had been a senior partner in the same law firm as the law minister for a long time they probably understand each other intimately we now learn from the Lee siblings that the AG also happened to be the Prime Minister ' s personal lawyer and that he had advised the prime minister specifically on the matters relating to the Lee estate now there is no legal prohibition on appointing the government ' s close friends and former party comrades as the AG or deputy AG but from a system point of view do these appointments instill public confidence that AGC will act independently in matters where the government or worse the Prime Minister has an interest in the outcomes at the time when the appointments were been considered were there no other qualified persons to take up those posts what about the many career legal service officers who had dedicated their lives to public service was there no one there good enough coming back to the facts at hand I am concerned about the conflicts of interest how will the AGC act in advising the government any decisions that wishes to tick on 38 Oxley Road has the AGC already been giving advice to the committee and who within the AGC is giving the advice hence the AEG recused himself from even touching the file since you have represented p . m . Lee in his personal capacity as a beneficiary what about the deputy AG if I understand that he only recently resigned as a card a member of the PAP when was this will he recused himself on the meta to since his former party leader the Secretary General is personally involved madam Sinha parents are upset over this saga for a multitude of reasons one consistent theme is embarrassment at a public airing of family disputes and that family matters should be settled privately another threat is whether the Prime Minister other ministers and the Attorney General had exercised their powers properly in handling matters touching on the Lear state my concern is on the letter particularly how we protect the rule of law and all institutions let us be most alive to the risk of a slippery slope that erodes public trust in the impending dependence of organs of states\"]\n",

citizens it ' s very early in the morning but let me say a few words to sum up this general election and the results I call this election because Singapore is at a turning point we ' re advancing beyond sg50 and I needed and asked for fresh and clear mandate from Singaporeans so that the PAP can work together with you in order to take the country forward I ' m happy with the outcome of the election the popular vote is 69 . 9 % nearly 70 percent we 183 constituencies out of 89 and what was particularly satisfying we won back Bongo least it ' s a good result for the PAP but it is an excellent result for Singapore I ' d like to thank voters of all ages all races across the island for their confidence and for their support because it ' s not possible to have a result like this across the board and such a high number without strong support from all groups and in particular it could not have been done without strong support from the young and that ' s a particularly important conclusion from this election because it shows that the young people understand what is at stake support what we are doing really to secure a bright future for Singapore and for the young and in due time we ' ll be able to can ' t take up this responsibility and take the country further forward at the same time I ' m deeply humbled by the confidence which Singaporeans have shown in me and my team and by the heavy responsibility which the voters have entrusted to us I ' d like to remind all my newly elected MPs that you are elected to serve the people that this mandate means that you have to work extra hard to serve because we are trustees and stewards we ' re elected to take care of Singapore to the best of our ability and we will have to account for our performance as a next general election after the hustings now we need to pull together to resume our nation building efforts we will work with all Singaporeans including those who voted against us in order to take Singapore forward this election results show that Singaporeans understand what is at stake that we can prosper only we stay united and that we need to get the best team possible assembled in order to serve Singapore the results are also an endorsement of the policies and the performance of the PAP government we ' ve worked hard to engage Singaporeans to partner you to solve problems to open new opportunities and to work out policies which suit our needs these elections have been closely watched you read the international newspapers BBC International Herald Tribune Financial Times we all write about it they all have some analysis and they ' re all waiting to see what this election will show so the results tonight will be noted by the outside world by the media of course but by by investors by other powers and by our neighbors and I believe these results will greatly bolster confidence in Singapore and in Singapore ' s future these results are also a strong signal of confidence to ourselves that we Singaporeans in the post Lee Kuan Yew air era are able to find the winning formula which can keep us progressing and succeeding one issue in this election has been the desire for diverse voices to be heard more in our political system I understand this we have a new generation with better education with access to social media who expect their views to be heard and given more weight and we have been engaging Singaporeans directly on the as a result of this enabling them to make a constructive contribution we also have gone into the social media since the election results since 12 of court I ' ve already had to face facebook posts and I ' m sure so have other candidates we will redouble these efforts but we must do this in a way that maintains the unique strengths of our system what are they these strengths the ability to maintain a national consensus over the long term the ability to keep our politics clean and non corrupt the ability to contain populist precious while being responsive to popular needs the ability to solve short - term issues but also focus on long - term opportunities and challenges and the ability to advance the shared interests of a broad majority of Singaporeans in Parliament we look forward to a full discussion and open debate on important issues because Parliament is where the most vital international issues should be debated and decided that depends on the government ministers and MPs but it also depends on the opposition and on other stakeholders on them making the effort to master the issues having the courage and commitment to take clear positions upholding the same standards of integrity and acting to advance the national interest and not for partisan advantage in the next parliament there will be nine opposition MPs six elected MPs and three non constituency MPs and we look forward to their contributions in parliament I ' d like to thank all the PAP activists and candidates who have worked so hard to serve voters to win their support to campaign during these nine days but much more than these nine days to have served during the past term of government and often for many years before that I ' d like to mention particularly our my satisfaction that we have one backbone wall east I sent Charles strong there he did an outstanding job as he has done more than once in his career and it showed that even though it may be an opposition ward we can make the fight take the fight to our opponent make the case to the voters and win them back and serve them well I ' m also pleased with a result in outcome SMC we did better this time than the last round we improved our vote share we knew it would be a tough fight I send Lee Hong Kong there he knew it would be a tough fight but he has done well he has shifted the sentiments and we will keep working hard to win over the voters and outcomes and one day we will win it back I ' m very pleased with the result in alternate GRC I spoke to the candidates this evening and congratulated them on what they had succeeded in doing we very nearly won to the point where we forced a recount and we missed only by 0 . 9 percentage points and that ' s it but next time we will get there so I ' d like to thank Victor Lee Yeo guat Kwang Murali trying lung sample gamma for an excellent job and I especially like to thank mr . Lim bone hang who has been their coach and mentor and her sir has helped to guide them to reach this point I should mention also the public servants who have worked hard throughout the day to serve Singaporeans voting taking care of them making sure everything will run smoothly thank you very much you made double efforts finally I thank my fellow Singaporeans for your strong mandate the elections are over but our work has just begun so let us unite those who work for us as well as those who didn ' t vote for us to build a bright future for every Singaporean my doula singapura now I take a few questions me yes morning hi Mei Wang Channel NewsAsia Prime Minister Li you said that you do see the need for more diverse voices you do hear the people and that how does pp intend to treat the system in order to allow that to happen in Parliament and how surprised were you at the outcome of this result in terms of having such a strong mandate going forward thank you well we have mechanisms in Parliament to debate here ' s a question of as I have said before is a matter of making full use of mechanisms but really of the content which goes in which should determines whether we have a good debate or not and I look forward to the opposition candidates all of whom belong to the Workers Party coming fully prepared to engage and to have a robust exchange on significant issues including all the issues which they have raised on the in the hustings which they haven ' t always previously raised during the parliamentary debate for example the minimum wage is a new subject which they have brought up which they never mentioned during the last term of the parliament as for the results we are pleased with the results I think it ' s exceeded our expectations and we will work very hard to meet the expectations of Singaporeans who have supported us and rightly expect us to serve them well yes go ahead sorry yes yes I think what tonight is not the time for hindsight tonight I ' m just summarizing the results and there ' s time enough for us to to play what if games later on yes well I think we have worked hard during not just during the last four years but even before that and but in this last four years the results have shown I mean improvements to the public transport system to the housing the improvements to the do the medicals Medicare and many fund the pioneer generation package all the policies which we have been working out over a long period of time some of which have come to fruition over the last four years and people have seen that we are working on their behalf and these policies are benefitting them I think that ' s a very important part I would say also that this being the sg50 year it has been a time for reflection and a time for people to realize what is at stake as you go forward beyond sg50 certainly in the celebrations we have taken great pains to explain to people why this is not just a party but really as a it ' s time for introspection time for commitment time for resolution and this election is part of that I think mr . Lee Kuan Yew ' s passing in March reminded people of these same verities and they are verities which have helped us come this far and I believe are relevant to us as we go forward into a changed world and I ' m glad that Singaporeans understand he am two questions one in Chinese and the second one is directed DPN Talman in English ask him in Mandarin okay yeah take that out to me naturally wait

into English and then we have pass it over to Tom on question is whether as a result of this strong Mandy the government will feel it has more space in order to carry out unpopular and difficult policies my answers we carry out the policies which will feel necessary and we will do that whether the majority is one of 50 or 70 and in this election I think the majority has other support has been good and it ' s a reflection of what we have done in the last more than four years not only doing the policies unnecessary but working hard to get them explained to people so people will understand it and will support it and even during the election campaign although I was often advised not to raise issues which are difficult to explain and may become a become an unhappy subject I felt it was necessary for me to touch on them not to go over all arguments again but don ' t account to people so that they understand our motives in doing this and so that there is nobody can say I ' m doing this behind anybody ' s back and when a moment came we avoided the subject we confront the subject we explain what we are doing we have a strong mandate now after that track record I think that we continue to do the things which are necessary and we continue to work hard to make sure that people understand and people support what we want to do and if we do well the results should show before the next election and we hope that it will be recognized in the next election if we don ' t do well I ' m sure the voters will know what has happened I don ' t read very much into the fine differences between the different constituencies as much as the very large swing we ' ve seen across the country very broad similarities across the country there ' s a swing in favor of the PAP and I think it reflects the factors that PM has just spoken about one way of thinking about it one way of thinking about the confidence that Singaporeans have expressed in the direction we are taking is the fact that if you look at the opposition proposals and platforms in this elections strip out some of the outliers and strip out some of the strengths of language used in rallies there ' s a very high overlap between what they were saying and what we are already doing and what we are going to do in the future as part of the PAP government ' s agenda very high over that whether it ' s foreign worker policy whether it ' s education whether it ' s Social Security well that ' s uplifting the poor they were seeing things that we are doing sometimes saying we should do more some slightly different proposals but basically it ' s the same agenda we have forged an agenda that reflects a consensus amongst the broad base of Singaporeans and people have confidence at that they also have confidence beyond policies beyond programs they have confidence in p . m . and his team as people who can be seen as trustees can be seen as stewards and that too is important in the election it ' s not just the policies it ' s who you see as a trustee and a steward going forward and I think this combination of factors accounts for quite a good swing in favor of the PAP which we which we take which we take in the spirit of let ' s work hard to put in place what we said we ' re going to do let ' s put full effort and full heart into this all right yes ROS be from with Tahiry and I have to question to ask for you and dr . yaku so just know tangey seems at times you see from symphysis ng serious attendees if he he said he was puzzled that the results of the vote is not consistent with the feedback that he and his team got from the people who expressed a lot of unhappiness of your policies to government policies what is your comment on then and dropped a ecause been the minister in charge of the Muslim Affairs and we what will be your message to them lames to community is pretty cognitively lens like b3 up there PP lang well I ' m not familiar with the feedback mechanisms of the opposition candidates but I would surmise that in this case is not just that he heard that people who are unhappy but yours actively trying to make people unhappy and what failed was not what his hearing but his trying which is just as well one thing and that ' s what p . m . has mentioned you will not have been possible for us we have a large swing without Mele support so I like first two ecco rpms it to thank the Malay community for giving the strong support and mandate to the party and I think the message from the community is very clear that what we have done within for the last 50 years is something which they appreciate because they have seen their lives improves more student doing one in university in fact in the next few hours I ' m gonna give up 500 Watts so our four paradigm and a Qian Agra in the afternoon so clearly I think they have seen the benefits of the PAP government last 50 years and they want more of that and having said that also in the last few days when I did my walk about together with my colleagues we have met a lot of our neighbors and community members who was strongly support what we want to do no ninja lumbers about across the island so my message to the Malaysian community let ' s continue to work together with the government to bring Singapore to SG 100 so that we can improve the lives of all Singaporeans including the Malay museum community how about saying that in Malay some of it that ' s what yet also said I ' ll try to do this at 4 a . m . in the morning service apparently the breeder is pretty scheming that my circulation Singapore oil

suggest you directed to some of the other members of my panel here and maybe particularly Channel has distinguished herself because she has demonstrated first time candidate can win in an SMC and a lady to boot what do you want to ask a question yes yeah you can do that because in some of the rallies are like some of some of the other KP candidate affair about your thoughts about the possible internal changes within a party right some of the changes that you think that people should have moving forward so right now it ' s a very strong mandate with such a high percentage of votes to what extent do you think that change within the party is still necessary no thanks really new to the party I would say this I I committed myself to contests as a candidate for the PAP because I could see that it is already evolving and changing in terms of policies in terms of the way in engages people there was our Singapore conversation which was a huge exercise and and over the years that it is always a party that ' s in evolution now with a very good mandate I think it is also important to analyze the results I think the lessons of victory sometimes is more important than the lessons of defeat now it tastes that both so the thing through about this too early in the morning for me to comment any further thank you okay I would wanted to ask something diverse my Yuya Thomas Calabrian a comment didn ' t an Ikea cabinet baru young cadet to wrap around my monkey knock and ECG only over on barovia da Vinci uncalibrated Monica dua Nadia come on Alan PPD GRC is cozia are diamagnetic are

comunidad well let me reply in English the first question is what about the new cabinet and new faces I think that ' s one of the first orders of business to form the new cabinet and to bring in the new faces and also to put the to reshuffle my cabinet so that the younger members are put into positions of greater responsibility quickly because as I said in this election one of the major items on my agenda was preparing a fourth generation leadership to be ready to take over and I want that to be done in this turn and we ' re going to start working I hope I will be able to have this done I ' m not sure I can do it before hire a Haji very soon after that perhaps in two weeks time on East Coast GRC there have been I we heard the alarms and we heard the feedback including from the media channel was very close to East Coast so she will tell you what she may have heard but our people on the ground told us that they had confidence and they were fighting it their way and they had been working in East Coast very hard for since they started the first day after the last election with a new team which was there and I ' m glad that their efforts have borne fruit and it has shown that they have established themselves with the voters in East Coast cheerio you want to say anything about East Coast time I think by and large the key for us is really the deeper engagement we ' ve been having with the residents and it ' s important that we put our residents welfare first I think this is what actually matters to us because we ' re there to serve them so whether it ' s function or even the East Coast team we ' ve been working very closely and have been exchanging notes on how to better serve our residents and I think that helps thank you right no further questions good morning to all of you go forth to SG 100 thank you very much\"]\n",
      "[\"yes Thank You speaker I ' m actually my clarifications on the similar point that mr . Murali raised because I think earlier a minister in his round up speech said that the returning officer could allow election departs to be paying cash if for example the electronic transfer failed so is that the only circumstance you know when care should be accepted meaning that there was some problem with the internet or electronic transfer because it does seem to send another barrier for candidates who may be raising money up to the very last minute and may not be able to do the funds electronically so I will ask Minister to give some indication that the returning officer should accept cash unless there ' s a very good reason why an accounting of any Yui care should not be accepted is because - in answer to both mr . Morales and mr . Williams question yes we hope that the primary mode will go towards the a pavement the transactions but in saqqaq extenuating circumstances as you have mentioned whereby you know the electronic payment system fail then we are able to accept cash oh you have last minute you are talking about crowdsourcing the last minute crop sourcing right so if there are extenuating circumstances I think you let the returning officers know and they will exercise the discussion meaning that actually um the failure of the electronic transfer is not a prerequisite that means to say there could be other circumstances why they could not do the electronic transfer\"]\n",
      "[\"I will focus my speech on the cost of living a topic which the Workers Party believes deserves closer scrutiny by the government for the remainder of the term and beyond the remaining workers party MPs will address other issues as covered in the addenda to the president ' s address in the last few years cost of living issues have dominated their headlines and more price rises are on the way with the prospective hike in the goods and services tax in the near future raising anxieties further more than one year ago in the wake of the announcement of a hike in water tariffs Deputy Prime Minister tio tio ji Heon so to assure the public that the price of coffee should not go up in the aftermath of the water hikes because the cost of coffee in a cup of in a cup is much much less than one cent and that the public should not be scared of untrue stories about coffee prices while this is true in a mathematical sense just a few days ago a Chow power report confirmed that one of the largest coffee shop chains had increased the price of coffee citing rising over hits one response to preempt cost - of - living concerns by the government at budget 2018 has been to enhance the GST use a voucher with each eligible household standing to receive five dollars more every three months between 2019 and 2021 to compensate for the recently announced carbon tax the PAP government ' s philosophy has always been to target assistance for those who govern the fear of overly generous welfare payouts for the able - bodied comes with a warning the message that can be inadvertently sent is that a person is not able to look after himself hence needing support and severely undermining the work ethic Singaporeans should not dismiss this concern but parallel expectations and considerations apply equally for the government - at the committee of supply debate this year the Transport Minister confirmed that Singaporeans can expect to see a rise in transport costs in the very near future - to reflect growing network capacity and ridership but as many callers to a local radio station commented not too long ago the cost of running and improving the transport system cannot just be seen through the eyes of fair revenue many correctly questioned whether there ought to be some school for other segments of SM artists business to subsidize train operations - such as advertising and revenue from other investments to lessen the effect of any fare increases on the general population mr . speaker the question of the quantum of the surpluses and the prospect of alternate revenue streams and future surpluses of many government in companies and stretched tree boards to better cushion price hikes on Singaporeans needs to be looked at very closely and debated before prices go up for example on the 30 percent water hike how do future capital investments in water supply and transmission go here with the large capital reserves of the National Water Agency which have increased consistently from around 3 billion dollars in 2007 to more than 5 billion dollars in 2016 getting into the details of such matters would represent a unique partnership with the people it would represent bold leadership but such an approach would also come with an up shop price hikes are likely to be better understood and contextualized to the benefit of the policy discourse in Singapore mr . speaker the president correctly pointed out that young Singaporeans want to feel a strong sense of nation raising our total fertility rate is an axis existential issue for our nation we know from a recent government survey that many married Singaporean couples actually do wish to have three or more children while 39 % felt this was an ideal outcome only 18 % were able to actualize it similarly when 53 % of couples I beg your pardon while 53 % of couples ideally wanted two children only 37 % were able to actualize it sixty - one percent of respondents raised financial cost as they are first out of three reasons for not having more children followed closely by the stress of raising children in Singapore at 56 % and the difficulty of managing work and family demands at 33 % if indeed the cost of living is a major impediment to having more children what can we do to address this issue how will we create a strong sense of nationhood when our Singapore core and the values internalized over 50 years of nation - building are progressively hollowing the selves up with the population not replacing itself sir immigration cannot be the long - term solution to our TFR woes immigration emigration to and we cannot be encouraging even more immigrants to set up home on our shores without a robust strategy to raise the Fr not to do so would severely impact the quality of life in Singapore for future generations in view of our limited size the problem is a structural one and structural changes are necessary and both thinking is required to break with the orthodoxy of the past is there scope to make HDB flats more affordable by pegging prices to income levels and flexible work arrangements become a compulsory option for new parents from employers what can we do to make the education system a reason for parents not to panic about having children is there scope to introduce more child support tax credits for low and medium and medium in parent medium income parents which can be scaled back progressively as household income increases unlike their predecessors the 40 leadership are coming into power when expenditures will rise in concert with the changing demographics of Singapore but that is only half the story on the question of finances the inclusion of the masse into the net investment returns contribution or an IRC framework from 2016 has also put more money and by extension more political capital in the hands of the current government in 4gv days than any generation of PAP leaders this is without having to even call on the President to unlock the reserves to put this in perspective the overall budget surplus for the term of father for this term of government for financial year 2016 and 2017 is currently at fifteen point seven billion dollars and this is after transfers to endowments and trust funds like the GST voucher fund the fifteen point seven billion dollars could potentially cover two more pioneer generation packages of about eight billion dollars each covering almost an additional 1 million more elderly and this is only taking into account the accumulated surplus out of two of the five years of this government ' s term in comparison the first and only drawdown of the reserves in 2009 requiring presidential approval amounted to 4 . 9 million dollars for the jobs Credit Scheme which extended a cash grant for every local worker on an on a qualifying employers payroll with a smaller amount allocated to financial institutions for the special risk sharing initiative with fifteen point seven billion dollars in hand today and given the putative least able formula for NRC withdrawals in spite of market fluctuations the picture for the immediate future does not appear to be one of a government needing money to stay afloat or needing to tax the population as a result raising the cost of living we are toll more money is needed for health care and other areas in years to come this is not unexpected given our demographic transition with our elderly population expected to grow to 900 , 000 by 2030 but what are the government ' s current estimates and the underlying basis for its projections of high expenditure coming on stream in future this information needs to be shared so that the public are clear - eyed about the sufficiency of the budget at the government ' s disposal to help Singaporeans with the cost of living today in conclusion sir the president ' s call not to s to bold changes is not one that should preoccupy the 4g4 generation leadership alone the leadership transition from the 3G to 4G leaders also presents a unique opportunity for each Singaporean to question what we can do to make Singapore better home for all of us the leadership team is no longer just the political leadership Singapore needs a special breadth and depth of leadership if it is to succeed leadership in every field of industry from trade and industry to sports arts and culture if Singapore is to thrive as the immediate geopolitical situation shifts and separately the challenge of an aging society inequality and an extremely low TFR confronts our small country boldness should be part of our national character too at its core the transition from the 3G to 4G leaders must be accompanied by a transformation of our society which creates the conditions to engender a confident people the impetus and authority behind the new bowl since Singaporeans should hearken back to the title of the president ' s address a call for strong people government partnership to build our future Singapore people who exercise independent judgment and who are empowered to support Singapore and to move forward together finally Mr Speaker I would like to put on record my thanks for Minister Minister Chen Xuan Singh ' s words on the workers party and mr . Latta Yang ' s contributions over the years the Workers Party will always bear in mind the national interest in our deliberations and endeavor in the interests of Singaporeans and Singapore thank you\"]\n",
      "[\"mr . speaker it is hard for anyone to believe that in this modern age we still sometimes cannot have a clear definition of what constitutes a valid vote in an election I ' ve seen a ballot paper with a faint squiggly cross mark inside a demarcated box rejected by an assistant returning office or aro on the basis that the intention of the voter was not clear I was flabbergasted and perplexed at the same time on how the aro could arrive at such a conclusion the set water could easily be an elderly person who for some reason could not imprint a more forceful mark on the ballot paper but that did not mean his or her intention was not clear in any way I ' ve also seen ballot papers with a thick and the diagonal line drawn across it well within the demarcated box for the preferred candidate being marked for rejection the reason a thick means yes but the diagonal I across it forms an X which means no so yes and no at the same time the intention of the voter was not clear yet I have seen an X map on the party logo area counted as valid I ' ve also witnessed symbols and expletives in the demarcated box of a ballot box counted as valid as well why us when I asked the returning officer to adjudicate on the validity of the rejected votes he said that the individual arrow at the respective counting table has the authority to discern such matter sir in the two general election contest there were at least six counting tables in each of the counting centers so I ' m looking at potentially six different interpretations of what constitute a valid vote just in one counting center alone how can we cause of a developed country when we cannot even define in simple term or without ambiguity what is a valid vote so are this amendment bill seeks to issue clearer guidelines on what the returning officer and the assistants should look for in a ballot paper when determining the intention of the voter I wish to seek some clarification from the minister and some of the proposed changes first cross 11 of this bill which amends in 42 of the parliamentary elections act introduces a new subsection 3 double - a which states that the voters mark on the ballot paper must be made in the area demarcated on the ballot paper for that purpose and not elsewhere sir to the visually impaired or elderly with poor eyesight putting a smock squarely within the area demarcated on the ballot paper can be challenging especially these voters do not want any help to do so for whatever reason I ' m sure many of us in this house would have come across ballot papers with the voters map imprinted outside the area demarcated for that purpose I believe the intention of these voters were in no way unclear however such votes would be demon Valley under the proposed amendment to section 42 of the parliamentary elections act we are an aging Society and we will see more and more elderly voters in time to come I have at most respect for these voters who despite the advanced age or disability are determined to play a role in shaping our democracy come what may it would be sad to know that the effort and passion would be in vain with the proposed amendment I seek more information from the minister to address this concern separately I hope the elections department could also look into designing a ballot paper with a larger area demarcated for the voters to map the Greater East second class within which amend section 50 of the principle introduces a new subsection to a to instruct the returning officer when determining whether a mark made on a ballot paper clearly indicates the voters intention to vote for the candidate or groups or candidates to disregard any mark that is not made within the area demarcated on the ballot paper for that purpose I wish to ask the minister does that mean that as long as a voters mark is made within the area demarcated on the ballot paper for the purpose a voter is allowed to exercise his artistic license elsewhere on the ballot paper and you would still be counted as a valid vote since the returning of Easter Mass do disregard are the Mac 400 ballot papers directly under this new amendment if a voter would cross out the name of particular candidate with words like clown my hero or mr . bean and then proceeded to put an X in the area demarcated on the Bella paper for the purpose with the returning officer be compared to treaty as a valid vote under this proposed amendment to section 50 of the parliamentary elections egg I hope the Minister can provide more clarity on his amendment else it will only cause more confusion voting is a serious act of civic responsibility I believe we should not allow the ballot paper to be mocked in any other way other than prescribed under the Act there should be no other man other than the mark left by the voter in the area demarcated on the ballot paper for that purpose returning officers should not be tasked to disregard any Adama found on the ballot paper but to designate such ballot as invalid as outright invalid voter education is also important beyond showing water where to mark on a ballot paper the elections Department should also educate voters on what will invalidate their boots at this juncture I wish to reiterate the Workers Party stand on the NC MP scheme we opposed the scheme as we believe in the fundamental principle that having more NC MPs is not a way forward to make a political system more robust so barring the member made to section 52 one of the principal actor revised the formula to determine the number of NC MP to be declared an election I do support a mmmm boom\"]\n",
