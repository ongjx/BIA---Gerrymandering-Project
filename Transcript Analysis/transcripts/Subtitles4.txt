Aaron speaker relief siblings have stated that their big brother has misused his position and influence over government agencies to drive his personal agenda and that they fear the use of organs of state against them these are serious charges and deeply troubling but to be fair to the Prime Minister are the allegations or rages are they merely a figment of the least siblings overactive imagination we in this house will not be able to get down to the bottom of these questions during this debate for one simple reason there is no natural justice in the procedure adopted but due respect to the Prime Minister we're only hearing the PM's version the government's version today what else there is we do not know in ghee delegations have been made today that the Lisa Billings have been selectively in the documentation and may not have been truthful they are not here to defend themselves I am not accusing the Prime Minister's life I'm simply stating what we all know that we simply do not have full information to confidently decide on who and what to believe notwithstanding the limited value of this session I wish to raise one matter that should be of concern to every Singaporean wishes to see Singapore as a bastion that upholds the rule of law and that is how fundamentally precious it is that we defend with all our hearts and minds the independence of our organs of state we must protect the organs of state as professional bodies with a national mission the government should never seek to interfere with or to influence those organs of state setup to ensure good governance for instance click the Auditor General's office da geo is an organ of state the Adriel prides itself in its core values of Independence and integrity in elaborating on its independence the Eijiro states that it carries out its audits without fear or favour in explaining its integrity the age your pleasures to strive to uphold the public trials in its work such a lofty mission is fleshed out in the agios annual reports which document publicly the financial management shortcomings of the ministries and the PMO the significant contribution of the ATO towards good governance and public accountability is clear to all of us I now turn to another organ of state the Attorney General's chambers according to the AGC website the AGC recognizes that and I quote as principal legal adviser to the government the Attorney General plays an important role in upholding the rule of law in Singapore and thus contributes to one of the key aspirations of her people to build a democratic society based on the fundamental ideals of justice and equality unquote madam make no mistake the AG is a fiercely powerful state actor more powerful than all judges when judges decide cases they are constrained by the laws passed by Parliament and their decisions are public and appealable by contrast the AG as the public prosecutor has almost absolute prosecutorial discretion he can decide not to charge a person who has committed an offense to let an offender offer the warning to reduce charges and so on these decisions are most gritty yes they are not public and not appealable it is not an exaggeration to say that all of us are the mercy of the AG but each of us should be fairly treated by him since under the Constitution all of us are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law even though the Attorney General is constitutionally a member of the executive he is expected to work independently it is stated in the AGC website that the AG his role as public prosecutor and I quote is vested with the power to Institute conduct or discontinue proceedings for any offence the Attorney General is independent in this role and not subject to the control of the god unquote these are the agency's own words Indy cars law ministers had expressly endorsed the need for there to be distance between the government and the AGC for instance professor STR Kumar recently gave an interview for a book marking a GCS 150th anniversary fair he recalled how when he was appointed Minister of State for law in 1981 he was given an office located at the AGC then in high street professor Derrick uma then be counted as follows and I quote I told the then Attorney General tan Boon dick that it was not proper for a Minister of State for law to be housed in the AGC because it would raise all sorts of questions about the agency's autonomy unquote fast forward to today in Prior debates this year I had raised questions about the appointment of the current AG and his newest deputy AG the role of the newest deputy AG as an immediate past MP is well known as for the AG it was also well known that he had been a senior partner in the same law firm as the law minister for a long time they probably understand each other intimately we now learn from the Lee siblings that the AG also happened to be the Prime Minister's personal lawyer and that he had advised the prime minister specifically on the matters relating to the Lee estate now there is no legal prohibition on appointing the government's close friends and former party comrades as the AG or deputy AG but from a system point of view do these appointments instill public confidence that AGC will act independently in matters where the government or worse the Prime Minister has an interest in the outcomes at the time when the appointments were been considered were there no other qualified persons to take up those posts what about the many career legal service officers who had dedicated their lives to public service was there no one there good enough coming back to the facts at hand I am concerned about the conflicts of interest how will the AGC act in advising the government any decisions that wishes to tick on 38 Oxley Road has the AGC already been giving advice to the committee and who within the AGC is giving the advice hence the AEG recused himself from even touching the file since you have represented p.m. Lee in his personal capacity as a beneficiary what about the deputy AG if I understand that he only recently resigned as a card a member of the PAP when was this will he recused himself on the meta to since his former party leader the Secretary General is personally involved madam Sinha parents are upset over this saga for a multitude of reasons one consistent theme is embarrassment at a public airing of family disputes and that family matters should be settled privately another threat is whether the Prime Minister other ministers and the Attorney General had exercised their powers properly in handling matters touching on the Lear state my concern is on the letter particularly how we protect the rule of law and all institutions let us be most alive to the risk of a slippery slope that erodes public trust in the impending dependence of organs of states
