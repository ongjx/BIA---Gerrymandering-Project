Chinese New Year is a time to celebrate with our families. It is a time to reflect on the blessings of having a family – to thank our elders for what they have done for us, to appreciate our spouses, to shower love on our children.  It is a time to enjoy the simple goodness of family.  

So even if we may be busy, travelling or living in far flung lands, unable to come together physically for the New Year reunion, let us make the effort to connect with one another.  On this most important festival in the lunar calendar, let us pause and remind ourselves of what truly matters in life, of what it means to belong to a family.  

The Government is doing all it can to help people build strong families.  We are encouraging couples to have more children. The Marriage and Parenthood Package will support them, as will more affordable childcare and pre-schools.  This year, we look forward to celebrating the birth of many Jubilee babies.  We are encouraging three-generation families to stay close-knit, and making it easier for young couples setting up home to live close to their parents, through targeted housing grants.  The Pioneer Generation Package, Silver Support and MediShield Life will lighten the burden on families taking care of elderly parents. 

Beyond our immediate family and relatives, we should also strengthen our larger national family. Singaporeans need to take care of one another, and especially of fellow citizens who are vulnerable or less fortunate.  We are strengthening our social safety nets. We have made it easier for low-income families to own their homes, introduced MediShield Life to give more protection against large hospital bills, reviewed CPF Life to help families better prepare for retirement, and expanded Workfare to support low-income workers and their families. The state and the community are bearing more risk on behalf of individuals, to give those who need help more peace of mind.  We are all in this together. 

We are doing all this to help our families stay together, not to supplant the role that families play.  Our family ties must not weaken, unlike what we have seen in other societies where the state has taken on more responsibility.  We must not let this happen in Singapore – either to our individual families, or to our larger national family.

Strong families are the bedrock of our society. Family members not only take care of each other.  They laugh and cry together.  Every member is shaped by every other.  Our families inspire us to be better, not just for ourselves but for each other.  Our families are always there for us, in sickness and in health, for better or for worse.

Generous social policies and grants by themselves do not grow strong or happy families.  A family is not just about whom we are related to, but how we relate to each other. Therefore, let us make the effort to build strong families – to spend time with each other, nurture our children, respect and care for our elderly parents, and through our deeds help those in greater need. 

If each of us plays our part, Singapore will continue to prosper and do well, not just economically, but as a harmonious and cohesive national family, diverse yet one.

Happy Chinese New Year!
