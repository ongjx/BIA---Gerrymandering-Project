Mr Goh Sin Teck: Mr. Prime Minister, I will ask the first question. The first question, let's talk about the relationship between China and China. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. In the past 25 years, bilateral relations have made great progress. But now some people are saying that China now has the same progress as China in 25 years. The value of Singapore may have changed for China. Others are saying that after the death of the founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the Sino-Singapore relationship has also undergone some new changes. If you look ahead, the new China-China relationship will have a new orientation, a new direction of development?


PM Lee Hsien Loong: I have seen earth-shaking changes in China for 25 years. Singapore is also changing a lot. Last year our bilateral trade, for Singapore, China is the largest trading partner. For China, Singapore is the largest foreign investor. This is an amazing number of words – such a small projectile small country can be China's largest foreign investor, but this is China's statistics. So if you look at the specific content, I think our bilateral relationship is deepening and broadening. Whether you are talking about economic relations or tourism or academic exchanges, or political or regional cooperation, we have a lot of rich content. Of course, our interests in China are different from those of 25 years ago. Because China’s reform and opening up 25 years ago, it has not gone so far. Singapore may have a “first mover” role that can help China explore the way forward, such as our Suzhou Industrial Park. However, China is very open today. China's contacts with many countries are already very developed and very prosperous. What is the role of Singapore? We are a small country and we are not the same as China. But we are an Asian country, we are looking for solutions and policies and methods to solve our own problems. China, a big country, can look at this small country, perhaps the experience of this small country, and perhaps the problem of this small country. Perhaps the result of this small country’s attempt has some reference value for China. In some cities, some places may have some ideas that are of interest to see, or even adapt to the application of China's national conditions. If we can do this, I feel satisfied.


Mr Goh: Looking ahead, there are several collaborative projects underway. The first one, I can now think of, for example, the third G-to-G (government-to-government) cooperation project.


PM Lee: I am thinking about it.


Mr Goh: We are also actively discussing the upgraded version of the Singapore-China Free Trade Agreement. What kind of driving force can you bring to our bilateral relations?


PM Lee: Of course we hope to be a positive and moving forward. We are still talking about the specifics. Because this third G-to-G cooperation project was established in line with the development of China's western development. We have a principled idea that this is a project of modern logistics and interconnection. The location of the project, we have three possibilities – in Chongqing, or in Chengdu, or in Xi'an. We have all visited these three places, but we have not finalized the last position. We hope to discuss with the Chinese side and be able to finalize this position and this content this year. Our two free trade agreements, we hope to have an upgraded version, because our free trade agreement has been in existence for several years now. The world has changed, and China and other countries have signed many free trade agreements. The new trade agreement is certainly more complete than the old one, and it is more inclusive. So we hope that our free trade agreement will also have an upgraded version. We discussed with the Chinese side and have agreed to implement a Joint Scoping Study. This Chinese is difficult to translate. However, China and China are called the “Upgrading Negotiation Research Working Group”, so there are many levels. But in any case we have to upgrade, so we must negotiate, we must study before the negotiations, there must be a group before the study. So the work has already begun. I hope that this year I can really start negotiations.


Mr Goh: It seems that my headline tomorrow morning is basically solved.


PM Lee: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.


Mr Goh: The Prime Minister just mentioned the interconnection. I just thought that what we have been talking about in the past two days is the idea of ​​the “Belt and Road” that President Xi Jinping mentioned. In fact, in the past year, such a concept has become almost all, political forums with the theme of China, or economic seminars, everyone is talking about this issue. From the perspective of a political leader, what do you think of the impact of such a concept on Singapore, on our entire region, and even on the entire cause?


PM Lee: We certainly hope that this “Belt and Road” initiative will drive the development of Asia and Central Asia. I think China also hopes to have good-neighborly and friendly relations with neighboring countries. So through this plan, through this whole concept, they can integrate many development projects and systematically promote it. Of course this is not the only plan for China. In addition to the “Belt and Road”, China also has AIIB (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank) – Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. China has also participated in the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership). I don't know how to translate in Chinese. However, in general, it is a free trade zone on the west coast of the Pacific. China also has bilateral free trade agreements with various countries. Therefore, the cooperation between China and neighboring countries is at many levels. In short, we all want to cooperate with China, but at the same time we also hope to have close ties with other big countries in the world. For example, Singapore, Singapore participated in the TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) talks. TPP, I think if everything goes well, it will soon be talked about. If successful, the TPP will be able to bring the countries on both sides of the Pacific closer, allowing us to work more closely together, allowing us to better engage in win-win, win-win economic integration. So I see, it is good for us to cooperate with China, but we also strengthen relations with other countries. Therefore, the network of relationships in the entire region can be relatively close, and will be diversified and multifaceted.


Mr Goh: Under such a background, the cooperation between ASEAN and China will be carried out more closely. Soon Singapore will take over the ASEAN-China relations coordinator from Thailand. Well, of course, if you talk about economic cooperation, there are many potentials and opportunities. But the reality is that there are some problems between ASEAN members and China. How do we see how we can better play our role as our coordinating country?


PM Lee: We are the coordinating country, not the leading country. So it is very clear to separate this role. The coordinating country We hope to make some contributions to the relations between ASEAN member states and China, that is, to coordinate the positions and viewpoints of the ASEAN countries and to make a concrete cooperation project. There are many cooperative projects, not only in economics, but also in education, as well as human resources, talent development, and various projects. I think these are relatively straightforward issues. Of course, our bilateral cooperation is not everything that is win-win, and some are conflicts of interests. I think the problem of the South China Sea is one of the examples. In this regard, ASEAN has the position of ASEAN. In fact, the positions of different countries in ASEAN are not the same, because some of them are complaining countries, some are not complaining countries, and some are not countries in the South China Sea coastline, such as Myanmar. Therefore, their position cannot be the same as that of the Philippines or Vietnam. Therefore, we are the coordinating countries. We hope to find common ground between different positions, and we can negotiate with China and advance. If we can't solve the problem, at least we can cool the problem. We can deal with it and avoid it affecting our broader win-win partnership. This is our hope.


Mr Goh: Prime Minister, I will ask another question, and then I will open it for everyone to ask questions. Those who want to ask questions may be ready to start thinking about the questions you are asking. My last question may be more specific. It was a lecture at the Singapore Management University a few weeks ago. You mentioned the challenges that Singapore faced in the next 50 years. You mentioned that the challenge in the medium term is the problem of the aging population in Singapore. A problem of ageing population or ageing is also a problem in China. Although we are small countries, they are big countries. Do you think that in the face of population aging and solving the aging of the population, what can be learned from each other in the two countries, what do you think of in management and in solving problems?


PM Lee: Our national conditions are different, but the basic nature of the problem has something in common. That is, our fertility is reduced, the population is aging, and the younger generation is not enough. So where the next generation comes from is a headache. Of course, China has family planning. For many years, a couple is only allowed to have one, so going to this side needs to change direction. Now that the direction has changed, in a particular situation, a couple can have two children. But now you can be born, couples don't want to be born, just like Singapore. We have an average of 1.3 couples. Sorry, we average 1.3 women for a woman. This is not enough. Because a woman, you are a person, a husband, so because there are at least two, so one third less, where to find it? We have a solution, that is, we can rely on foreign workers and can rely on immigration. China has no way to rely on foreign workers and immigrants. China is the world's most populous country. Your population is aging and there is no way to introduce it from foreign countries. So I think the problem in China is more difficult than us.

Of course, our problems are not easy to solve, because immigration and foreign workers are a very sensitive subject, and everyone has strong opinions. We published a white paper two years ago to discuss our population policy. The people have a very strong population response, and our government feels it and understands it. This reaction is completely understandable. But the government still has to do our best to find the most appropriate way to deal with this inevitable challenge. Therefore, we have now slowed down the number of foreign workers coming in, and the number of our immigrants has been properly and appropriately controlled. So from a numerical point of view, I think our policy is correct. But from a perceptual point of view, it is not easy for the people to accept, to understand, to identify and to support. I can only say that we have a lot of specific reasons. I don’t think we want to hear more reasons. What everyone wants to know is what I sincerely say, that is, we have this responsibility, we are the government of the country, we are the leaders, we need to lead the country, we need to make the best decisions for Singaporeans. It is a tough question, we still have to make the best decisions for everyone, and then explain to everyone. Therefore, our intentions are good. Everyone may have a different opinion on the content of the policy – ​​because it should be faster, slower and more. Give my workers a little more and give his workers a little less. Everyone thinks this way. But in general, I hope that everyone accepts the government's intention is good. We are doing this for Singapore and for the sake of Singaporeans.


Mr Goh: Ok. Thank you, Prime Minister. I will be open to this session and let everyone ask questions. When you ask questions, let us abide by several principles. The first is to ask for your name, simply introduce yourself, where you come from, and which institution. Please try to keep your question simple and want. We are here to listen to the Prime Minister’s dialogue, not to listen to your speech, so everyone bears with me. We will ask the first one to ask questions. Come, this gentleman.


Q: Hello Prime Minister. I am Zhang Weiwu (harmony) of the Singapore branch of China Merchants Bank. I want to ask a question about the renminbi. As the Singapore renminbi bank, the Workers Bank is committed to promoting Singapore as an offshore renminbi center with MAS. My question is, what opportunities do you think the internationalization of the currency has for Singapore? What are the opportunities that can be brought to Singapore by RMB internationalisation? In which aspects of the Singapore government and financial regulators can be further strengthened to promote the internationalization of the renminbi, and to further build Singapore's status as an offshore financial center through the internationalization of the renminbi. Thank you.


PM Lee: I think the internationalization of the renminbi is a policy that must be considered in detail for the Chinese government. It is impossible to fully open internationalization at night. But I think the Chinese government intends to gradually relax controls so that the renminbi can fluctuate more freely and be used for a wider range of transactions, including Capital Account. If you can do this, Singapore certainly feels like a good thing. We are a financial center. We have a variety of currencies in Singapore, whether it is US dollars, or Euro, or Japanese yen, or RMB. We all hope to be able to go through our various banks and financial companies in Singapore. Convert it and be able to apply it. If the renminbi can also be included, I think that many trades in the region, especially with China, will use the renminbi. Then Singapore can have a clearing bank, be able to trade in renminbi, or the possibility of futures, of course, for our financial center. Ok.

However, for China to relax the control of the renminbi, it must be carefully considered. Because this is not only a question of currency exchange rate, but also a problem of economic stability and a problem of stability of the entire financial system. Because all banks, all investment companies, if they are not mature enough in China, are not prepared enough, then open, out of control, I think there is a profound impact. I think the Chinese government Mr. Zhou Xiaochuan is very clear about this.


Mr Goh: Thank you. Now sitting on the stage, I know that the past day, everyone will say, please ask everyone to ask questions when you want to be slower. Because I am sitting on the stage, I understand that its echo is really not easy to listen to. So when you ask questions, please slow down your speed a little, and we will hear more clearly on the stage.


PM Lee: So my answer can be slower.


Mr Goh: If you would like to ask you question in English, please feel free to do so as well. There is one over there.


Q: Hello Prime Minister, I am Chen Yingxi, an investment partner of Sequoia Capital. I want to ask you, the smart country, what you advocate, Singapore is the world's first smart country. What do you think can be done with China?


Mr Goh: He is a Singaporean businessman.


PM Lee: I see our smart country, we are thinking about how to do it. I think there are many aspects in terms of technology and technology. We certainly welcome China's participation. What is a smart country? This, many countries have different views. But our view is this – there are many cities that are called smart cities. Urban management can be computerized and systematized. Its sensors are closed-circuit televisions, or sensors, or some reports of traffic flow, and information can be collected. We have the information, we can respond in time, and manage the city in time. Singapore is not just a city, Singapore is a country. Therefore, in addition to the level of urban management and the national level, we can also systematically use information technology to transform our past management and operation into a system that is more convenient, more sensitive, and more adaptable to needs and changes in different environments. So whether it is a small journal name, or a report of some of the company's business, or a report on some law and order, or a transportation system, all of us in a country can be connected. Or it is hygienic, we can also connect. No matter which hospital you go to, we know your background, the prescriptions you have used in the past, what are the symptoms, and what are the needs. To see your old X-ray, we can also raise it right away, and we can share everything, without taking photos, and taking photos. This can be done by one country, not the same as China. China, a city you can do, but the provincial level is another layer. At the national level, it is another layer. It is not easy to collect them all. We can do it, and it may be a small model that China can refer to.


Mr Goh: Maybe our experience in this area can also be used in the third G-to-G...


PM Lee: We are not experienced enough yet, we are just getting started.


Mr Goh: Okay. I tried. The latter gentleman first mentioned, then this gentleman.


Q: Hello, Mr. Prime Minister. I am an entrepreneurial representative from China. Coincidentally, my name is Zhao Runlong (harmony). Like you, there is a "dragon" word, so I see you are very kind. You and Mr. Lee Kuan Yew are my little idols. I used to see you in the book. Now I have finally seen the real person for the first time. You are much more handsome than the book. I am the founder and CEO of Net Finance. Net Finance is an internet finance company. I am also a post-80, I am this forum may be the youngest guest, I am only 30 years old. One question I want to ask is actually like this. In the past 20 years, Singapore and China have two very friendly countries and two countries with very many cooperation. In the past economic development, we have learned a lot from Singapore, including the economy, including trade, and so on. The question I want to ask is, in the current business environment, in terms of entrepreneurship, what can young Chinese entrepreneurs learn from Singapore as a young entrepreneur? At the same time, you also know that China’s entrepreneurial atmosphere in salary is also very strong. Conversely, I also want to know that there are places in China that are doing well. What can Singapore learn from us? Thank you.


PM Lee: I think we have been engaged in business for a while, but we think this is not easy to do. Because of an entrepreneurial environment, reducing difficulties and reducing inconvenience, this government can do it. But to promote everyone's entrepreneurial spirit, and to have entrepreneurial inspiration, where the inspiration comes from, it is difficult for the government to say "you come" immediately. Inspiration must come from entrepreneurs, investors, entrepreneurs, they have a new vision, they want to change the world, they start from scratch, fail, try again, fail, try again, and finally succeed. We have been doing it for many years and now there have been some initial developments. We have an entrepreneurial center called Block 71, which you may have heard. If you go there, there are quite a few big and small companies, we offer one called incubator – the incubator. Everything is available, as long as your small company is there, we support you, and you may be better. There are companies on the other side, large-scale, groundbreaking, companies like Lenovo, or Huawei, which we have not yet reached this level, and hope to reach it one day. But small companies, they feel that they have begun to form a climate, and there are some. What can China learn? I see the situation in China is different from ours. You have a lot of talents and you have a big market. But one thing is the same, that is, to have entrepreneurial spirit, we must have an open, competitive market. In other words, what do you want to do, the government tries not to delay you and does not stop you. Market cooperation, or trying, requires new talents. I think it is entirely possible to do it yourself, without relying on the government, or relying entirely on government subsidies or government plans. You said that China's entrepreneurial environment is small. In fact, the environment for entrepreneurship in China is not small. I have been to Shenzhen, Shenzhen has many talents, and there are many, many companies. Everyone wants to be tomorrow's Huawei, tomorrow's Lenovo. If you go to Zhongguancun, there are also many young people who want to break through. There are also many venture funds, and Venture Capital goes there. In fact, I hope that we are a small witch, I hope to attract some people from China to Singapore, to start a business in Singapore, so that our development environment can be more driven.


Q: I am from Beijing, Tsinghua University Law School, Wang Zhenmin (harmony). I have two questions. One problem is that you just said a number, and now Singapore is the country with the largest overseas investment in China. Before, we know that this number has always been Hong Kong.


PM Lee: Hong Kong is not counted because Hong Kong is in the country.


Q: That is clear. Is there any competition between Hong Kong and Singapore in this respect? In terms of connecting with the world as China? It’s good to speak like your Mandarin. Many people in Hong Kong don’t speak Mandarin.


PM Lee: But I can't do it in Cantonese.


Q: The second problem is that Singapore's governance across the country and urban governance has always been a sample that many people in China feel should be learning. You feel that in this respect, especially because I am a legal professional, what kind of experience can Singapore provide for China in terms of legal construction? Thank you.


PM Lee: First of all, Singapore competes with Hong Kong. I don't know if I asked Mr. Tung Chee-hwa about this issue yesterday. Because for Singapore, we don't think we are competing with Hong Kong. We recognize that Hong Kong is at the door of China and is a country, two systems, so it has completely different status from Singapore. We fully understand and accept this. Hong Kong's investment in China I want to be ten times bigger than us. But we have a different foothold, so we have a world view that is different from Hong Kong. What we care about is not only the total country, but also Southeast Asia, and also South Asia – India, and other South Asian countries, as well as some countries in Australia and Oceania, and other important economies of the world. China is an important trading partner and economic partner, but it is not the only one, so it is different from Hong Kong. For Hong Kong, Hong Kong has contacts with the world, but China is the biggest factor in Hong Kong's success. Hong Kong people think this is, I am very difficult to speak for Hong Kong people, but Hong Kong people think this is a very important backing, but it is also a lot of pressure, so we are not the same as their status. People say that we are competing with Hong Kong. I said that the world is very big. There is no risk of competition in our two small places. Of course, sometimes everyone fights together, but in many cases they can cooperate and be friendly. We have a lot of friends in Hong Kong. I believe that there are also many Singaporean friends.

You talked about the issue of the rule of law – where we govern the country and how China manages the country. The political systems of our two countries are different. We are a multi-party system of parliamentary democracy, and China is the party that governs the country. China has Chinese politics, but many are political within the party. We have our politics, politics, and especially a game between the party and the party. The whole system, and importantly, how our politics evolved, we all hope that people in politics will recognize that their mission is to succeed for Singapore, not for their party, or part of their community. This is a very basic factor, and we are different from other countries in Singapore. Other countries fight with the party, I have my faction, you have your faction. Maybe my faction is a certain geography and region. Yours may be another area. Or maybe mine is the working class, you are the bourgeoisie, or it is divided by race and religion.

We, the Singapore People’s Action Party, want to represent the interests of the vast majority of Singaporeans. Regardless of race, religion, speech, and rich or poor, whether you are in the western, southern or northern part of Singapore's eastern countries, we all hope that you will support the DAP and we will do our best to serve you. Therefore, this competition with multiparty is at least a tension, and can even be said to be a contradiction. However, we feel that if we can maintain such a political system, it is good for Singapore. If we become another system – the DAP only represents the poor, or just the rich, or just the Chinese, then I will see it in Singapore, this is a very bad phenomenon.

Therefore, China said that the three representatives may be similarly conceived, that is, not only those who represent a certain class, but people who represent all classes in society, all who advance and serve the society. How to do it? There is no contradiction in society. Of course, China has some social contradictions. We also have some social contradictions. But if we can resolve this contradiction as much as possible and be able to represent different interests by one party, I can see the stability of the country and the future of the country is more secure. This is our experience. Of course, China is very different. China's experience, I think you are much more than me.


Q: Prime Minister, first of all thank you for being again with us for the FutureChina Global Forum. I'm Claude Smadja from Smadja & Smadja, Switzerland.


PM Lee: How do you do, Dr Smadja? Good to see you again after many years.


Q: Very good. It is a pleasure and honour to see you. My question to you is in fact very simple. You are a very small country, so you depend a lot on the environment in the regional and global level. When you look At the situation outside of Asia and in Asia, what are the two or three major sources of concern that you may have about development or risk that could affect negatively, Singapore?


PM Lee: At the highest level, I think one very important factor is relations between America and China, because it is the most important bilateral relationship the world. If it is stable and both countries are cooperating with one another, it makes it very easy for a small They have problems, if they are at odds with one another, many countries will be forced to have sides, and would feel very uncomableable having to do so. That is one big thing we worry about. Another thing we are concerned about is the stability and cooperation within our own region, in Southeast Asia. ASEAN is working towards an ASEAN community (ASEAN Economic Community) at the end of this year. It is an economic community, free trade area, as Well as other economic cooperation.But each ASEAN country has its own internal preoccupations and concerns. I do not have to go into all of them now but if you read the newspapers, you would see and you would know what these issues are. or it is Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand We have to watch very carefully our neighbours' preoccupations, because (if) they go wrong in some way, it is a douse for us. We have such intimate Relations with them that if they get sick, we will fall ill. So that is the second concern.We have to watch very fine our neighbours' preoccupations, because (if) they go wrong in some way, it is a douse for us. We have such intimate relations with them that if they get sick, we will fall ill. So that is The second concern.We have to watch very fine our neighbours' preoccupations, because (if) they go wrong in some way, it is a douse for us. We have such intimate relations with them that if they get sick, we will fall ill. So that is The second concern. I had mentioned the third thing which worries us a lot, that is a security issue, and that is the problem with extremist jihadists' terrorism. ISIS is the latest manifestation, before that it was Al-Qaeda. A lot of foreign fighters have gone To Iraq and Syria. From Southeast Asia, hundreds have gone to Iraq and Syria. From Malaysia, maybe hundreds; from Indonesia, definitely many hundreds; some from Thailand, even from China, some Moguls have found their way into ISIS in the Middle East It is a faraway battle but people are drawn in. They get sucked in, they get radicalised. One day some of them may come home, some of them have already come home, they will bring the virus back and cause a lot of trouble In our society. As a multi-racial society in Singapore, that is a very, very dangerous threat which we are watching very carefully.


Mr Goh: The KPI given to me by the organiser is that I must have a good mix of questions – questions from the ladies and also from the gentlemen; a good mix of questions in English and in Chinese; good mix of questions from Singaporeans and Foreign guests. So please help me to hit my KPI.


Q: My name is Ben Lim, I am with Reuters in Beijing, the North Asia specialist correspondent. Allow me to ask the Prime Minister in Chinese. Xi Jinping has been on the stage for more than two years.


PM Lee: Sorry, I can't hear clearly.


Mr Goh: You are slower.


Q: Ben Lim from Reuters, Chinese name is Lin Guangyao. Reuters. Xi Jinping has been on the stage for more than two years and has done a lot of things, including anti-corruption, including the rule of law, including reform. Of course, I also recently included some AIIB, as well as the AIIB, and the 'Belt and Road'. May I ask the Prime Minister, these practices of Xi Jinping in China, what things make you more worried, or do you feel more assured, or do you feel confident in China?


PM Lee: We are always very concerned about China. We have different opinions on various policies. It is of little value to point them out here. However, it can be said that China under Xi Jinping has done a lot of work in these two years. I know that he has considerable challenges in China. In foreign countries, China also hopes to have good-neighborliness and cooperation with all its neighbors. We also hope that China can do the same thing together. It’s hard to be alone, so if two people work together, I can see a lot of things.


Mr Goh: This lady.


Q: Hello Dear Prime Minister. My name is Wu Changhua, I am the Greater China Director from The Climate Group. I am based in Beijing. I am going to shift the focus a little bit to the broader context, which is sustainable development. Later this year, there would be Two major events at the international level. One is September at the UN General Assembly. The international community will come together for the sustainable development goals. And end of this year in Paris, climate change convention or protocol will be coming together. I would be Very interested to hear from you directly, your commitment from Singapore's perspective to sustainable goals and also leading up to Paris, what is Singapore's position or commitment to international climate change issues. Thank you very much.


PM Lee: This is a very complex question. The specialists spend many nights worrying about it, but it is a very big problem for the world because human activity is changing the global climate, changing irrevocably, and the cost for undoing that change or even slowing down that Change is very, very high - very high economically and impossibly high politically. That is a reality. Yet we have to get to to do what we can in order to the same as the environment and to adapt to the changes which are inevitable, And which are already underway. It is a problem which all the countries have to come together and solve, especially the big countries. In this context, they are called "major emitters" – the ones that emit a lot of carbon into the air, Or methane or greenhouse gases. China has a big role to play in this.I think it is not just for the sake of the world but for China's own interest. If it does not make changes, it will be very severely impacted by climate changes which are underway, in terms of irrigation, in terms of agriculture, because you Will have drought, you have desertification, in terms of sea level rise, in terms of coastal areas which are going to be inundated, and typhoons which are going to be more intense.

These are major impacts which will affect all countries including China, and for China's own interest, it has to act. Of course it can't go on its own, it has to act together with other countries. I think its agreement with America to Make certain commitments is a valuable first step, but it can only be a first step. Progressively further steps have to be taken. Singapore, if you take a practical view, my explanation has been even if we stopped breathing in Singapore, it will make But difference to the world climate, because we are so small. But as a responsible member of the global community, we will do our part together with other countries, in an international agreement. We have to do our fair share. What we can do , depends on our circumstances too, and our circumstances are some special, because unlike other countries,We only have fossil fuels. We can have a certain amount of sunshine and solar power, but we can't have nuclear because the island is too small. We don't have hydro, because we don't have mountains and rushing rivers. We don't have geothermal, we don't have the possibilities of other renewable energies like wind, and so we have to depend on fossil fuels and it is not possible for us to say "we will not use fossil fuels". But within Those constraints, we will do our part and we hope that there will be a good agreement in Paris this year in December.And so we have to depend on fossil fuels and it is not possible for us to say "we will not use fossil fuels". But within those constraints, we will do our part and we hope that there will be a good agreement in Paris this Year in December.And so we have to depend on fossil fuels and it is not possible for us to say "we will not use fossil fuels". But within those constraints, we will do our part and we hope that there will be a good agreement in Paris this Year in December.

We have been very active working in the UN framework. Previous meetings trying to be countries together so that we can have a fair agreement which in the end is wearable and which people would uphold and implement. That is a small contribution which we think we can Make.


Mr Goh: You can see how hands-on PM is. We have a tight time today, and there is still an event after the Prime Minister. The organizer told me that we only have 5 minutes left. Maybe I will pick up two more questions and ask together. One after the other, we ask the Prime Minister to answer.


PM Lee: Ok, good. Bilingual.


Mr Goh: The best of bilingual.


Q: Prime Minister, good afternoon everyone. Weng Wenlin (harmony), now working in the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City, is also a native Singaporean. But fortunately, I also worked in China for about 10 years. Today I have two simple questions. The first question is the cooperation between China and New Zealand. Of course, we have established diplomatic relations for 25 years. Therefore, I would like to listen to some of the views of the Prime Minister, that is, how do you think about the new cooperation in the future, and boldly imagine the relationship between China and New Zealand after 10 or 20 years.

The second question: I was also educating this before, so I care more about young people. The new cooperation also requires some contributions from some of our future generations. I would like to take this opportunity to listen to the views of the Prime Minister. Today, I will use this occasion to give us young people or our future, the next generation, some advice or some words. Thank you.


Q: Hello. I am Wang Liwei (harmony) from Caixin. If I remember correctly, it was also on this rostrum two years ago. Our editor-in-chief Hu Shuli and Mr. Huang Jing actually talked about China's reform prospects after the Third Plenary Session. I would like to ask your opinion – is China still in a phase of domestic reforms, but in the international arena, including the “Belt and Road”, the AIIB initiatives have made great progress? Thank you.


PM Lee: This is a very difficult question to answer. I think that after 25 years, the relationship between Singapore and China depends not only on the environment of Singapore and China, but on China's position in the world. That is to say, if China can continue to develop peacefully and continue to play an active role in the international community, the country and other major economies and countries can cooperate friendly. I think Asia is stable, peaceful, and new. I think the relationship is the smoothest development. If this is not the case, if the world becomes a turbulent situation, or at least a tense situation, then of course the relationship in many countries will be affected. We all hope that in the next 25 years, China's relations with the region will be the same as China's relations with the region in the past 25 years. The difference is that China is now a very large economy, and it is almost the world's largest economy. China’s every move will affect the situation in other countries around the world. Therefore, under such circumstances, China can not continue to move forward, while continuing to make other countries accept China's status, China's contribution, China's influence, I think this is the most important issue. This is not just about our bilateral relationship with China, because there are more than 200 countries in the world, and Singapore is just one of them. However, if this major factor is done well, then I will see the New Zealand-China relationship, of course, the ship will not be a problem.

For the advice of young people, I don’t think it is necessary. Young people never listen to advice.

As for you saying that China's domestic development and foreign development, I think China's domestic development, I believe that the Chinese government has done a lot of things. The report of the Third Plenary Session is very complete. However, it takes a while for China's domestic development to hand over the transcripts. Foreign, some diplomatic actions, you announced, everyone thought it was a big event, but it was not in place yet. Therefore, I believe that Chinese leaders, what they are most concerned about, should be domestic development. Abroad, of course, AIIB, "One Belt, One Road", these are all important, but domestic development, this is the most fundamental, because if there is a problem in China, then China can't exert its international influence, I believe this is definitely China. Leader's consideration.


Mr Goh: Thank you, Prime Minister.
