mr. speaker it is hard for anyone to believe that in this modern age we still sometimes cannot have a clear definition of what constitutes a valid vote in an election I've seen a ballot paper with a faint squiggly cross mark inside a demarcated box rejected by an assistant returning office or aro on the basis that the intention of the voter was not clear I was flabbergasted and perplexed at the same time on how the aro could arrive at such a conclusion the set water could easily be an elderly person who for some reason could not imprint a more forceful mark on the ballot paper but that did not mean his or her intention was not clear in any way I've also seen ballot papers with a thick and the diagonal line drawn across it well within the demarcated box for the preferred candidate being marked for rejection the reason a thick means yes but the diagonal I across it forms an X which means no so yes and no at the same time the intention of the voter was not clear yet I have seen an X map on the party logo area counted as valid I've also witnessed symbols and expletives in the demarcated box of a ballot box counted as valid as well why us when I asked the returning officer to adjudicate on the validity of the rejected votes he said that the individual arrow at the respective counting table has the authority to discern such matter sir in the two general election contest there were at least six counting tables in each of the counting centers so I'm looking at potentially six different interpretations of what constitute a valid vote just in one counting center alone how can we cause of a developed country when we cannot even define in simple term or without ambiguity what is a valid vote so are this amendment bill seeks to issue clearer guidelines on what the returning officer and the assistants should look for in a ballot paper when determining the intention of the voter I wish to seek some clarification from the minister and some of the proposed changes first cross 11 of this bill which amends in 42 of the parliamentary elections act introduces a new subsection 3 double-a which states that the voters mark on the ballot paper must be made in the area demarcated on the ballot paper for that purpose and not elsewhere sir to the visually impaired or elderly with poor eyesight putting a smock squarely within the area demarcated on the ballot paper can be challenging especially these voters do not want any help to do so for whatever reason I'm sure many of us in this house would have come across ballot papers with the voters map imprinted outside the area demarcated for that purpose I believe the intention of these voters were in no way unclear however such votes would be demon Valley under the proposed amendment to section 42 of the parliamentary elections act we are an aging Society and we will see more and more elderly voters in time to come I have at most respect for these voters who despite the advanced age or disability are determined to play a role in shaping our democracy come what may it would be sad to know that the effort and passion would be in vain with the proposed amendment I seek more information from the minister to address this concern separately I hope the elections department could also look into designing a ballot paper with a larger area demarcated for the voters to map the Greater East second class within which amend section 50 of the principle introduces a new subsection to a to instruct the returning officer when determining whether a mark made on a ballot paper clearly indicates the voters intention to vote for the candidate or groups or candidates to disregard any mark that is not made within the area demarcated on the ballot paper for that purpose I wish to ask the minister does that mean that as long as a voters mark is made within the area demarcated on the ballot paper for the purpose a voter is allowed to exercise his artistic license elsewhere on the ballot paper and you would still be counted as a valid vote since the returning of Easter Mass do disregard are the Mac 400 ballot papers directly under this new amendment if a voter would cross out the name of particular candidate with words like clown my hero or mr. bean and then proceeded to put an X in the area demarcated on the Bella paper for the purpose with the returning officer be compared to treaty as a valid vote under this proposed amendment to section 50 of the parliamentary elections egg I hope the Minister can provide more clarity on his amendment else it will only cause more confusion voting is a serious act of civic responsibility I believe we should not allow the ballot paper to be mocked in any other way other than prescribed under the Act there should be no other man other than the mark left by the voter in the area demarcated on the ballot paper for that purpose returning officers should not be tasked to disregard any Adama found on the ballot paper but to designate such ballot as invalid as outright invalid voter education is also important beyond showing water where to mark on a ballot paper the elections Department should also educate voters on what will invalidate their boots at this juncture I wish to reiterate the Workers Party stand on the NC MP scheme we opposed the scheme as we believe in the fundamental principle that having more NC MPs is not a way forward to make a political system more robust so barring the member made to section 52 one of the principal actor revised the formula to determine the number of NC MP to be declared an election I do support a mmmm boom
