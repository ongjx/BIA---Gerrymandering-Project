a lot of people say can we have a two-party system that's the ideal that's how many developed countries work that's what you should aim for a change of government from team the first party to the second and then from the second to come back and then you are considered to have matriculated but how could this happen in Singapore that we have two parties I can imagine several scenarios first the society splits based on race or religion you have one party representing one race or religion another party representing another race or religion that's the worst possible scenario for Singapore and we've done our best to make sure that it never comes about because if you are split on race on religion you're not just going to have political quarrels they are going to divide the society and that's the end for Singapore your second possibility is that you divided on class lines we don't get our economy economic policies right or maybe just the world trends are such the rich get richer the poor don't make progress after a while the poor lose hope in the system the rich lose interest in the rest of society and they say that so one side says text me less let me keep my wealth the other side says give me more transfer more welfare more goodies more benefits and you have two parties forming one representing one group the other one representing the other group rich and poor I think we should try the maximum extent that we can align all the interest of Singaporeans and make sure that one party can represent you whether you are the CEO or whether you're the taxi driver the third possibility is that we split on policy grounds you argue that this set of policies will be best for Singapore to grow promoting mncs they argue that no I don't want MMC sending them all the way and depending on Singaporeans and Singapore companies is a way to grow and we can't reconcile and we split and we over the policies and fight it out in the polls I think is that could happen but it's not so likely because the PAP is a pragmatic party and we are ready to take in good ideas but the most important reason why a two-party system is not workable is because we don't have enough talent in Singapore to form to a teams to form to really first-class teams to govern Singapore really well more than any other country singapore needs exceptionally able leadership to tackle challenges and to minimize the risks for our country where small we are vulnerable with a mediocre government other countries may muddle through and have to muddle through but singapore will fail the most effective way to get a two-party system if you really want to do it is to split the PAP into because the talent is there is gathered we will have two persons I choose one you choose one I choose one you choose one okay now we have two teams now we play toss the coins we seriously considered making the PAP two parties not that way but in principle but we didn't do it because we couldn't solve one problem how can you make two teams each one as good as the original one team which we had which took really what would have been the best players from both teams or to put it in very hard and direct tangible terms where can you find to finance ministers and to defense ministers I have one finance minister and one defense minister if you have a spare one somewhere please let me know why do I choose these two because these are two of the most difficult jobs in the cabinet to film in finance you have to make judgments on taxes affecting all Singaporeans on expenditures affecting all ministries on the budget they're talking about 50 billion dollars of expenditure every year as well as on our reserves gic Thomas a mes and others adding up to more than 100 billion u.s. dollars to find one of them is not easy to find two of them you must really your baby is the same as defense in a curiously opposite way because finances about money and is very difficult and defense is very difficult because it is not about money because the bottom line is intangible security risk threats judgment what is worth spending on what is worth investing on which is the right aeroplane to buy how many ships do you need which kernels to make general how to shape the SEF which threats are getting serious when do I recommend to mobilize the SAF when do I decide I must deploy and defend can you easily find anybody off the street to do that sort of job very very difficult so therefore I think one team get the best people together fill each job with the best man if we split into two teams then whichever one is in charge the government is going to be weaker and the chances of something going wrong will go up definitely even if things don't go wrong standards will go down and that's why I and all my predecessors have gone out of our way to skul the land for talent to join the team and every election we have 20 odd candidates become new MPs and out of these on average i did account over the last five or six elections about three make it to become minister but we have 14 ministries to fill and then on top of that you need some supervising ministers and DPMS I'm senior missus ministers because you need some additional experience than oversight of the systems of the system so just just say fourteen ministries to Phil and I can get three new ministers each term you do the math 14/3 means on average each Minister has reserved at least four terms the opposition parties pitch themselves as offering Singapore fall back should the PAP fail it sounds plausible but if you think about it what does it depend on most critically it comes back to talent again if the PAP can't assemble a second team I don't think the opposition will find it easier to do that you look at it from the micro view consider a capable person weighing his options trying he wants to serve the nation he's trying to decide how to do it which way he should go and he has two choices first choice join the opposition oversee the pap but really spend his life and can be quite a long time waiting and watching just in case they're PAP screws up then he'll be ready to take over the other alternative is joined the government help it to make better decisions implement good policies and avoid making mistakes and screwing up now which makes more sense for him and for Singapore so I think for all these reasons I think the best thing for us to do is to concentrate our resources and form one really strong Singapore team some people who want to join the opposition yes we want to propound alternative policies or they want to be a check on the government that's valid by all means join the opposition especially if the government is wrong or incompetent but so long as the government is competent and doing a good job for Singaporeans I hope you make common cause with it and help us to ensure that things stay right but what we can do and must do to assure Singapore's future is to develop the strongest possible 18 with depth and resilience competent ministers people with expertise in different ministries plus depth younger ones learning the job so that as the situation changes as we have new needs we can always find the right person for the right job and if one person doesn't work out I can do a replacement I can call a timeout change my team member and the game goes on actually that's how soccer is played if you watch world cup soccer every country only has one team no country feels two teams for the World Cup soccer you have one national soccer team you have reserves players you have coaches you can change players and if need be you can even change the coach but you concentrate all your talent make one team and give it your best shot whether it's Johannesburg all rio de janeiro and i think that's what we should do we are not so successful in soccer but we are not doing badly in government and I think that we should keep up our winning streak and stay in the championship league in the international contest of Nations
