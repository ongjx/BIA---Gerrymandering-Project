india Borden to York on Kwon Minah gentle wrong woman tissue tone sincerely Dajjal can mean how does in Java friends and fellow-citizens it's very early in the morning but let me say a few words to sum up this general election and the results I call this election because Singapore is at a turning point we're advancing beyond sg50 and I needed and asked for fresh and clear mandate from Singaporeans so that the PAP can work together with you in order to take the country forward I'm happy with the outcome of the election the popular vote is 69.9% nearly 70 percent we 183 constituencies out of 89 and what was particularly satisfying we won back Bongo least it's a good result for the PAP but it is an excellent result for Singapore I'd like to thank voters of all ages all races across the island for their confidence and for their support because it's not possible to have a result like this across the board and such a high number without strong support from all groups and in particular it could not have been done without strong support from the young and that's a particularly important conclusion from this election because it shows that the young people understand what is at stake support what we are doing really to secure a bright future for Singapore and for the young and in due time we'll be able to can't take up this responsibility and take the country further forward at the same time I'm deeply humbled by the confidence which Singaporeans have shown in me and my team and by the heavy responsibility which the voters have entrusted to us I'd like to remind all my newly elected MPs that you are elected to serve the people that this mandate means that you have to work extra hard to serve because we are trustees and stewards we're elected to take care of Singapore to the best of our ability and we will have to account for our performance as a next general election after the hustings now we need to pull together to resume our nation building efforts we will work with all Singaporeans including those who voted against us in order to take Singapore forward this election results show that Singaporeans understand what is at stake that we can prosper only we stay united and that we need to get the best team possible assembled in order to serve Singapore the results are also an endorsement of the policies and the performance of the PAP government we've worked hard to engage Singaporeans to partner you to solve problems to open new opportunities and to work out policies which suit our needs these elections have been closely watched you read the international newspapers BBC International Herald Tribune Financial Times we all write about it they all have some analysis and they're all waiting to see what this election will show so the results tonight will be noted by the outside world by the media of course but by by investors by other powers and by our neighbors and I believe these results will greatly bolster confidence in Singapore and in Singapore's future these results are also a strong signal of confidence to ourselves that we Singaporeans in the post Lee Kuan Yew air era are able to find the winning formula which can keep us progressing and succeeding one issue in this election has been the desire for diverse voices to be heard more in our political system I understand this we have a new generation with better education with access to social media who expect their views to be heard and given more weight and we have been engaging Singaporeans directly on the as a result of this enabling them to make a constructive contribution we also have gone into the social media since the election results since 12 of court I've already had to face facebook posts and I'm sure so have other candidates we will redouble these efforts but we must do this in a way that maintains the unique strengths of our system what are they these strengths the ability to maintain a national consensus over the long term the ability to keep our politics clean and non corrupt the ability to contain populist precious while being responsive to popular needs the ability to solve short-term issues but also focus on long-term opportunities and challenges and the ability to advance the shared interests of a broad majority of Singaporeans in Parliament we look forward to a full discussion and open debate on important issues because Parliament is where the most vital international issues should be debated and decided that depends on the government ministers and MPs but it also depends on the opposition and on other stakeholders on them making the effort to master the issues having the courage and commitment to take clear positions upholding the same standards of integrity and acting to advance the national interest and not for partisan advantage in the next parliament there will be nine opposition MPs six elected MPs and three non constituency MPs and we look forward to their contributions in parliament I'd like to thank all the PAP activists and candidates who have worked so hard to serve voters to win their support to campaign during these nine days but much more than these nine days to have served during the past term of government and often for many years before that I'd like to mention particularly our my satisfaction that we have one backbone wall east I sent Charles strong there he did an outstanding job as he has done more than once in his career and it showed that even though it may be an opposition ward we can make the fight take the fight to our opponent make the case to the voters and win them back and serve them well I'm also pleased with a result in outcome SMC we did better this time than the last round we improved our vote share we knew it would be a tough fight I send Lee Hong Kong there he knew it would be a tough fight but he has done well he has shifted the sentiments and we will keep working hard to win over the voters and outcomes and one day we will win it back I'm very pleased with the result in alternate GRC I spoke to the candidates this evening and congratulated them on what they had succeeded in doing we very nearly won to the point where we forced a recount and we missed only by 0.9 percentage points and that's it but next time we will get there so I'd like to thank Victor Lee Yeo guat Kwang Murali trying lung sample gamma for an excellent job and I especially like to thank mr. Lim bone hang who has been their coach and mentor and her sir has helped to guide them to reach this point I should mention also the public servants who have worked hard throughout the day to serve Singaporeans voting taking care of them making sure everything will run smoothly thank you very much you made double efforts finally I thank my fellow Singaporeans for your strong mandate the elections are over but our work has just begun so let us unite those who work for us as well as those who didn't vote for us to build a bright future for every Singaporean my doula singapura now I take a few questions me yes morning hi Mei Wang Channel NewsAsia Prime Minister Li you said that you do see the need for more diverse voices you do hear the people and that how does pp intend to treat the system in order to allow that to happen in Parliament and how surprised were you at the outcome of this result in terms of having such a strong mandate going forward thank you well we have mechanisms in Parliament to debate here's a question of as I have said before is a matter of making full use of mechanisms but really of the content which goes in which should determines whether we have a good debate or not and I look forward to the opposition candidates all of whom belong to the Workers Party coming fully prepared to engage and to have a robust exchange on significant issues including all the issues which they have raised on the in the hustings which they haven't always previously raised during the parliamentary debate for example the minimum wage is a new subject which they have brought up which they never mentioned during the last term of the parliament as for the results we are pleased with the results I think it's exceeded our expectations and we will work very hard to meet the expectations of Singaporeans who have supported us and rightly expect us to serve them well yes go ahead sorry yes yes I think what tonight is not the time for hindsight tonight I'm just summarizing the results and there's time enough for us to to play what if games later on yes well I think we have worked hard during not just during the last four years but even before that and but in this last four years the results have shown I mean improvements to the public transport system to the housing the improvements to the do the medicals Medicare and many fund the pioneer generation package all the policies which we have been working out over a long period of time some of which have come to fruition over the last four years and people have seen that we are working on their behalf and these policies are benefitting them I think that's a very important part I would say also that this being the sg50 year it has been a time for reflection and a time for people to realize what is at stake as you go forward beyond sg50 certainly in the celebrations we have taken great pains to explain to people why this is not just a party but really as a it's time for introspection time for commitment time for resolution and this election is part of that I think mr. Lee Kuan Yew's passing in March reminded people of these same verities and they are verities which have helped us come this far and I believe are relevant to us as we go forward into a changed world and I'm glad that Singaporeans understand he am two questions one in Chinese and the second one is directed DPN Talman in English ask him in Mandarin okay yeah take that out to me naturally wait watch a hotel for return Tokyo compare accountant Titan and the co2 emissions by 2020 I mean you can't order kanji encourage it regime will be showing the chanter yo-yo l'chaim energy ghost engine for depend on your vote shows nearly 80% do you think this a reflection of your personal popularity or also an endorsement at what extent is that a reflection of personal popularity an endorsement of the PAP policies and duty the government has gotten the balance right between social economic policies oh let me answer first woman suits under lenient sir this thing she are stressing the tensor Rulon's

mean meet shared about saliency sir woman short order puts us at a sham in your house who Tong so he showed us a mineral LG hurts it sir but let me let me translate this into English and then we have pass it over to Tom on question is whether as a result of this strong Mandy the government will feel it has more space in order to carry out unpopular and difficult policies my answers we carry out the policies which will feel necessary and we will do that whether the majority is one of 50 or 70 and in this election I think the majority has other support has been good and it's a reflection of what we have done in the last more than four years not only doing the policies unnecessary but working hard to get them explained to people so people will understand it and will support it and even during the election campaign although I was often advised not to raise issues which are difficult to explain and may become a become an unhappy subject I felt it was necessary for me to touch on them not to go over all arguments again but don't account to people so that they understand our motives in doing this and so that there is nobody can say I'm doing this behind anybody's back and when a moment came we avoided the subject we confront the subject we explain what we are doing we have a strong mandate now after that track record I think that we continue to do the things which are necessary and we continue to work hard to make sure that people understand and people support what we want to do and if we do well the results should show before the next election and we hope that it will be recognized in the next election if we don't do well I'm sure the voters will know what has happened I don't read very much into the fine differences between the different constituencies as much as the very large swing we've seen across the country very broad similarities across the country there's a swing in favor of the PAP and I think it reflects the factors that PM has just spoken about one way of thinking about it one way of thinking about the confidence that Singaporeans have expressed in the direction we are taking is the fact that if you look at the opposition proposals and platforms in this elections strip out some of the outliers and strip out some of the strengths of language used in rallies there's a very high overlap between what they were saying and what we are already doing and what we are going to do in the future as part of the PAP government's agenda very high over that whether it's foreign worker policy whether it's education whether it's Social Security well that's uplifting the poor they were seeing things that we are doing sometimes saying we should do more some slightly different proposals but basically it's the same agenda we have forged an agenda that reflects a consensus amongst the broad base of Singaporeans and people have confidence at that they also have confidence beyond policies beyond programs they have confidence in p.m. and his team as people who can be seen as trustees can be seen as stewards and that too is important in the election it's not just the policies it's who you see as a trustee and a steward going forward and I think this combination of factors accounts for quite a good swing in favor of the PAP which we which we take which we take in the spirit of let's work hard to put in place what we said we're going to do let's put full effort and full heart into this all right yes ROS be from with Tahiry and I have to question to ask for you and dr. yaku so just know tangey seems at times you see from symphysis ng serious attendees if he he said he was puzzled that the results of the vote is not consistent with the feedback that he and his team got from the people who expressed a lot of unhappiness of your policies to government policies what is your comment on then and dropped a ecause been the minister in charge of the Muslim Affairs and we what will be your message to them lames to community is pretty cognitively lens like b3 up there PP lang well I'm not familiar with the feedback mechanisms of the opposition candidates but I would surmise that in this case is not just that he heard that people who are unhappy but yours actively trying to make people unhappy and what failed was not what his hearing but his trying which is just as well one thing and that's what p.m. has mentioned you will not have been possible for us we have a large swing without Mele support so I like first two ecco rpms it to thank the Malay community for giving the strong support and mandate to the party and I think the message from the community is very clear that what we have done within for the last 50 years is something which they appreciate because they have seen their lives improves more student doing one in university in fact in the next few hours I'm gonna give up 500 Watts so our four paradigm and a Qian Agra in the afternoon so clearly I think they have seen the benefits of the PAP government last 50 years and they want more of that and having said that also in the last few days when I did my walk about together with my colleagues we have met a lot of our neighbors and community members who was strongly support what we want to do no ninja lumbers about across the island so my message to the Malaysian community let's continue to work together with the government to bring Singapore to SG 100 so that we can improve the lives of all Singaporeans including the Malay museum community how about saying that in Malay some of it that's what yet also said I'll try to do this at 4 a.m. in the morning service apparently the breeder is pretty scheming that my circulation Singapore oil Americus to due to an apparent Allah when Allah can only prevent a PAP slam Wilma puta hoon recommend

they cannot get a discouraged oh ok I will just take one more question Israeli at night I suggest you directed to some of the other members of my panel here and maybe particularly Channel has distinguished herself because she has demonstrated first time candidate can win in an SMC and a lady to boot what do you want to ask a question yes yeah you can do that because in some of the rallies are like some of some of the other KP candidate affair about your thoughts about the possible internal changes within a party right some of the changes that you think that people should have moving forward so right now it's a very strong mandate with such a high percentage of votes to what extent do you think that change within the party is still necessary no thanks really new to the party I would say this I I committed myself to contests as a candidate for the PAP because I could see that it is already evolving and changing in terms of policies in terms of the way in engages people there was our Singapore conversation which was a huge exercise and and over the years that it is always a party that's in evolution now with a very good mandate I think it is also important to analyze the results I think the lessons of victory sometimes is more important than the lessons of defeat now it tastes that both so the thing through about this too early in the morning for me to comment any further thank you okay I would wanted to ask something diverse my Yuya Thomas Calabrian a comment didn't an Ikea cabinet baru young cadet to wrap around my monkey knock and ECG only over on barovia da

kalau Mookie nada GRC a MOOC India to Allah GRC that will happen with a companion by comunidad well let me reply in English the first question is what about the new cabinet and new faces I think that's one of the first orders of business to form the new cabinet and to bring in the new faces and also to put the to reshuffle my cabinet so that the younger members are put into positions of greater responsibility quickly because as I said in this election one of the major items on my agenda was preparing a fourth generation leadership to be ready to take over and I want that to be done in this turn and we're going to start working I hope I will be able to have this done I'm not sure I can do it before hire a Haji very soon after that perhaps in two weeks time on East Coast GRC there have been I we heard the alarms and we heard the feedback including from the media channel was very close to East Coast so she will tell you what she may have heard but our people on the ground told us that they had confidence and they were fighting it their way and they had been working in East Coast very hard for since they started the first day after the last election with a new team which was there and I'm glad that their efforts have borne fruit and it has shown that they have established themselves with the voters in East Coast cheerio you want to say anything about East Coast time I think by and large the key for us is really the deeper engagement we've been having with the residents and it's important that we put our residents welfare first I think this is what actually matters to us because we're there to serve them so whether it's function or even the East Coast team we've been working very closely and have been exchanging notes on how to better serve our residents and I think that helps thank you right no further questions good morning to all of you go forth to SG 100 thank you very much
