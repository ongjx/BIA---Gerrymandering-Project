Dear Swee Say,

As you step down from the Cabinet, I am writing to thank you for the many contributions that you have made to Singapore.

We first knew each other more than forty years ago, when we were both serving in the SAF. I got to know you better when I was Minister for Trade and Industry and you headed the National Computer Board, and later, when we worked together on the Suzhou Industrial Park project. You struck me as a determined, passionate leader who delivered results. You had a warm, down-to-earth personality. On the ground you were practical, persuasive and effective. I thought these attributes suited you to a political path, and so approached you to join politics in 1996.

I am glad you agreed. Before you were elected to Parliament, we sent you to the NTUC, where you quickly won the trust and affection of the unionists. Three years later, you left the NTUC to become a Minister of State, in the Ministry of Trade and Industry and concurrently the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology.

You were appointed Minister for the Environment in 2001. There, you introduced NEWater, a game-changer in our water story. The challenge of NEWater was not the science or engineering, though it took bold imagination and hard work to develop the technology. It was to persuade Singaporeans to accept the idea of recycling and consuming used water, a delicate matter of psychology and public confidence. This you achieved brilliantly. You guided PUB to come up with the name NEWater, and the idea of packaging NEWater in elegant bottles, branded just like high-end bottled water. You worked hard with PUB colleagues, reaching out to business leaders, grassroots leaders, student leaders, and the community-at-large to gain public support. Your Cabinet colleagues gave you full support: during the 2002 National Day Parade we all led a toast to Singapore with NEWater. Today, Singaporeans are happy and proud to use NEWater, which accounts for up to two-fifths of our water needs. This has fundamentally changed our water situation, and substantially overcome a strategic vulnerability that has obsessed us ever since independence.

You returned to the NTUC to serve fulltime as Deputy Secretary-General in 2005, to prepare to succeed Mr Lim Boon Heng as NTUC Secretary-General two years later. Mr Lee Kuan Yew wrote in his book “Hard Truths” that “not everybody can work with the NTUC and grassroots leaders…Lim Swee Say is a natural”. Under your leadership, NTUC expanded its membership significantly, adding more young members to its ranks through the Young NTUC and the nEbO Club. You also worked with the Government to review and amend the Employment Act to raise standards and provide protection for more workers, including Professionals, Managers and Executives. You worked hard to uplift low-wage workers. One important idea was the Progressive Wage Model (PWM), which reassured and encouraged lower wage workers that they had a clear career progression and the hope of future wage increases. 

In all your appointments, you firmly upheld the importance of creating jobs for Singaporeans. You dedicated yourself to helping workers stay employable, as the best form of welfare and worker protection. Your first initiative in NTUC was the Skills Redevelopment Programme to equip workers with portable skills through skills certification. During the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-2010, you persuaded employers to cut costs to save jobs instead of cutting jobs to save costs. As a result, as soon as the storm passed, the economy recovered quickly, or as you put it, “upturned the downturn”. In 2008, you established the Employment and Employable Institute (e2i) as a central resource for workers to obtain training and job placements. e2i has since grown from strength to strength, and benefited more than 600,000 Singaporean workers.

From 2011 to 2015, you were concurrently the Deputy Chairman of the People’s Association. There you expanded our grassroots network and outreach. This proved very useful later when we implemented the Pioneer Generation Package and MediShield Life.

In the Party, you served at different times as Chairman of Young PAP and Government Whip. On the ground, you were a committed and indefatigable MP, first representing the constituents in Buona Vista, before moving over to lead East Coast GRC in 2011. All your residents speak warmly of your approachability, unassuming demeanour and powers of persuasion. They enjoyed chatting with you, and appreciated your efforts to explain key Government policies in a clear and often entertaining manner.

In 2015 you were appointed Minister for Manpower, where you built on your work at NTUC to improve the welfare of workers. You brought to MOM a strong understanding of the labour market, and how to balance the interests of workers with the needs of businesses. You managed the strong political pressures on our foreign worker policies, and prioritised the Singaporean core of our workforce. You set up comprehensive programmes under “Adapt and Grow” to train workers and help them find new jobs, including the Professional Conversion Programmes, Career Support Programme, Career Trial etc. You strengthened the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) and the Fair Consideration Framework, to protect workers from unfair discrimination. To help workers retire well, you raised the reemployment age, raised CPF contribution rates for some older workers and gave CPF members more options to save for retirement. At the same time, you built trust with employers, working closely with industries, taking in feedback and fine-tuning manpower policies to support their needs. Both businesses and workers found in you a reliable, trusted partner who understood their concerns and aspirations.

My letter would not be complete without mentioning your knack for simple and effective messaging. Till today, many Singaporeans recall with a smile the vivid catchphrases that you coined over the years. Amongst the most memorable are “cheaper, better, faster”, “better, betterer, betterest”, “futurise” and most recently, “1/3 + 2/3 > 1” to describe our workforce composition. These were not idle wordplay or poor math, but embodied important economic and manpower realities and priorities in a form that Singaporeans could understand, remember and act upon.

You have been an invaluable member of my team, and will be deeply missed. You often said that “people don’t care how much you know, until they know how much you care”, and you lived by this mantra. Even though you are stepping down from Cabinet, I am confident that you will continue to serve your constituents well and contribute to Singapore and the labour movement in many other ways.

I wish you the very best in your future endeavours.

Yours sincerely,

LEE HSIEN LOONG

Dear Hng Kiang,

Among the third generation ministers, I have known you the longest, for more than 40 years. We were contemporaries in Cambridge, we entered public service together, and we have worked with each other in multiple roles.

Over many decades, you have served the country with dedication and distinction. In Cabinet, you have carried heavy responsibilities, and implemented many policies to improve people’s lives and advance Singapore’s interests. You are steady under pressure, analyse problems rationally and objectively, and have a sensitive feel for political considerations. Your approach is hard-headed and practical, yet infused with a human touch.

You have helmed the Ministry for Trade and Industry for the last 14 years, developing economic strategies to build resilience and sustain growth in an uncertain global environment. At the macro level you aimed for economic growth, and kept the economy growing vigorously, even at our high per capita GDP levels. At the micro level you understood that market forces were often the best way to accomplish policy objectives, but also knew how to intervene when markets did not work well, or to achieve social goals.

You built up key industry clusters in the manufacturing sector, including petrochemicals, semiconductors and life sciences, by promoting foreign investments and creating the right conditions for the sectors to grow. You marshalled resources and expertise through SPRING, IE Singapore, and JTC, to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to upgrade, grow and internationalise. In 2005, you created the Competition Commission of Singapore to ensure industry competition and properly functioning markets. You also focused MTI on its core mission of promoting economic growth and creating good jobs, by rationalising your statutory boards and associated companies, and divesting activities which operate better as private entities, such as Ascendas and Jurong International.

Externally, you worked hard to build trade relationships with other countries. You and your team negotiated an extensive network of free-trade and partnership agreements, which were of both economic and strategic value to Singapore. With our ASEAN partners, you pushed for the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint 2025. This year, we signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), after many years of hard work. After the Trump administration withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, you worked with the other 10 remaining countries to find common ground, and to conclude a CPTPP agreement that preserved almost all of the original deal.

In times of economic stress, especially during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, your calmness and experience were pillars of strength. You systematically reviewed the options, and worked out a bold and effective package of measures, including notably the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative and Jobs Credit schemes. This response bolstered confidence, saved jobs, and enabled the Singapore economy to recover swiftly.

Before MTI, you served as Minister for Health, where you had dealt with an equally difficult crisis: the SARS outbreak in 2003. All of us, including the Government, worried about the consequences. We were under enormous pressure to stop the virus from spreading. We had to limit the loss of lives, prevent fear and panic, and contain damage to the economy. We did not know if our measures would work or if the epidemic would slow. We had to make tough decisions on the spot – to close down the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market where cases had been discovered, thereby affecting many livelihoods; to institute temperature taking in schools and at our borders, to detect possible SARS cases; to impose home quarantine on those who had come into contact with SARS cases, and so prevent the infection from spreading. Amidst general fear and alarm, you assessed the situation and made sound decisions. After the crisis passed, the World Health Organisation praised Singapore’s response to the outbreak. The measures that you had put in place during SARS helped us to meet subsequent public health threats, such as the H1N1 influenza pandemic in Singapore in 2009.

In your first ministry post, as Minister for National Development, you made it a priority to enable low-income families to own homes. You launched initiatives to increase home ownership, including a scheme for sitting tenants to buy over their rental flats, and building new, elderly-friendly studio apartments for seniors. These policies continue to give Singaporeans a tangible stake in the nation’s future.

Your legacy in our built environment is felt in many other ways. Many residents in private estates have benefitted from the Estate Renewal Strategy that you started in 1995. You also built a Downtown core at Marina Bay, not only creating a new financial district, but also providing new tree-lined paths, open-air cafes, and a world-class concert hall – the Esplanade Theatres on the Bay – for Singaporeans to enjoy.
While managing your ministry portfolios, you gave full attention to your constituency and residents. For more than 20 years, you have helmed the West Coast GRC as Minister. Your residents know you as a hardworking and personable MP who can be counted on to resolve municipal problems and see to their concerns. Their confidence in you and your GRC team is reflected consistently in successive election results.

Throughout your career, you have worked for the best interests of Singapore and Singaporeans. I and my colleagues will miss your pragmatic, farsighted approach to issues and your wise counsel in Cabinet. But I am happy that you will continue to stay active in Singapore’s affairs, as you will continue serving as an MP, and also remain Deputy Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and a Director of GIC.

I wish you all the best in your future endeavours.

Yours sincerely,

LEE HSIEN LOONG
