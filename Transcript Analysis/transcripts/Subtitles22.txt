and not sure whether our neighborhoods are as you say they are you know I work with that people at the bottom of the scale and we see quite a different picture to the picture you've been painting and I think we also need to talk about how whether or not median income is a good measure what's going on you know we have people in your party who are earning in the millions of dollars and I had my lunch at the beach road Hawker Center there's a 71 year old Hawker who is earning six hundred and fifty dollars a month your party earns less than your ministers are less than that in a day so we must not look purely at what's happening at the median but we have to drill down to the individual voters whom we are here to serve rather than just to lead because it's always the hard way that is projected to the world but the software that we are into but the lower low end of our low income which we should be addressing and it will take up like now if you go into healthcare it's actually going into the Japanese kind of era where you know Japanese by 2055 you will have the facing the silver population 1 1 point 2 is to 1 to 2 to to take care of the other to the elderly well this is where we should have focused on some measures on health care today so this is this is a long term thank you just a few more seconds left I think what I want to say is that change can the PAP guarantee that it will continue on their track record record for the next 30 years is that safe to put all our eggs into one basket without an alternative Lina well I should put you in one will let my husband use the power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely so I think that we should have more option members of parliament okay well I'm afraid we have run out of time for this segment of the discussion mr. Tom and I believe that that Gerald threw you a question would you like to respond before we move on to the next segment I think the one thing that makes us different from most of the countries is that the ruling party the PAP is a party that cares for the average Singaporean and the lower-income Singaporean no other society that comes close where 85% of those in the bottom 20% of our society own their homes and where the bottom 20% of society receives a very substantial transfer benefits every year far more than the taxes they pay we have one of the most progressive tax systems in the world and certainly amongst developed countries so this is a government that cares for not just those at the top those in the upper middle income group those at the bottom the individual hawker the individual cleaner the individual production worker that's our brand of government that's the way we will continue to run this place to the point about poor people I think in any society no matter how well we do there will always be a segment who are trying to catch up I think the important question is that what are we doing to help them rather than just talking about them I mean if you look at the efforts that we have occurred over the last few years some are very encouraging we talk about workers who are stuck in jobs that don't pay very well we have the inclusive growth program we work hard with companies on board they are already at least 200 and through the efforts of the inclusive growth programme 20,000 workers will benefit and I think that these efforts are what will really make a difference to the lives of Norwich workers instead of us just talking about them let's put our efforts into really helping them through these very difficult but ultimately successful and effective measures okay well thank you thank you for viewing it go for break when we return we will discuss two hot-button issues the cost of living and foreign workers stay tuned and welcome back to the program in this segment which will adopt the discussion format we will explore the more immediate issues facing Singapore media corpse Today newspaper commissioned a survey recently and out of more than 600 people polled one in two say the rising cost of living is more likely to influence how they cast their ballot compared to other hot-button issues such as housing and foreigners so let's kick off this segment by asking the opposition why the cost of living is the hottest of issues and we'll get the finance minister to respond to the issues raised who like to start you know during our house visits I have to agree with that survey because during our house visits and women when you talk to residents cost of living definitely is biggest the biggest issue that they have and we feel that very often the rhetoric that we hear from the government is that all cost of living is beyond our control because we are such a small country and we are influenced by external factors but we believe that lots of levers that the government has to control the cost of living and I think there's a lot more that the government can do control what lever does your party have okay firstly the the government has has the levers to control it things like HDB prices that contributed to a large part to people's cost of living we one of the proposals we have is that the cost of the HDB flats should be pegged to the median incomes of the Singaporeans who are eligible to buy HDB flats it should not be pegged to the market and with the market subsidy that what the government calls it things like rentals all are affected to a great extent by by they contribute to the cost of doing business and that contributes to to people having to pay more for their goods and services Lina SPPs use but I think the open-door immigration has a lot to play with it because we are trying to get in as many immigrants as I mean our citizens as much of it I think they say that I want to be about six million if I'm wrong I correct me if I'm wrong and I think that this put a constraint or the cost of living housing medical transport school and Roman and etc etc and I believe that we should look carefully to see whether we should do we need to have that amount of population in Singapore because it's land constraint and we don't have hinterland yeah but let's just stick to the issue of the cost of living I'm I would like to move now to yes and I said can I hit carry on again a quick point so living is maybe the privatization of over in markets also eat the cost of living because I know what Marcus you know you people can buy cheaper goods but now with the privatization of all these red markets I think it's more expensive to buy then certain SDT self cost of living well I'm not surprised that that's a key issue because you know it's getting impossible to live in Singapore we are one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in and I don't think that's an accidental thing I agree with Jarrell that it's government has a you know that's part of what government is there to do to ensure that people can live well we we have to remember the universe inflation is significantly higher at the moment higher than the government self is issuing alarm bells sounding alarm bells about it other costs that we have that are also rising healthcare costs I know a taxi driver who I was in his cab when he said he couldn't afford a cataract operation because of the exorbitant costs yesterday in the Straits Times there was an article about a young woman who went to for a specialist appointment via the polyclinic so a public patient and she was given a three-month waiting period and she was told by that hospital and she asked three other hospitals who also said to her that if you went as a private patient the waiting time is reduced to three minutes and the difference in price is 25 for a polyclinic and 17 what's one thing your party might propose to mitigate well you're saying initially zero rate GST for basic services GST as a consumption text everybody who studies these matters knows that the GSD a consumption tax is one of the most inequitable taxes you can ever devised because the rich and the poor have to buy the same amounts of rice and bread and oil and sugar so we say zero rate GST for basic products and have a great data GST all the way up to luxury items we also say that the HDB housing system should be run as a non-profit that's been brought up already by Jerrold nothing not to say my question will be the forwards have agreed to Stillman sitting the high cost of living what should be the factor will be the housing high cost per house the healthcare education even in fact and also some essential items which I think be zero GST policy should be should be there then getting generous plastic on housing I think the housing issue is very very busy here so like I say a public issue should be a public issue but then commercial issue so I think the ministry or the ministry itself have put this public issue into a commercial platform so it becomes a demand and supply issue so if I won't go into statistic if the rental flats at now which is less then the supply addendum the demand the queues are so long but then again we have we are having few block I mean many blocks of flat which is read driven and privatize to be rental s private and the fair why not push it can I make one very question you go to thumb and I just wanted to say thumb and ended the previous segment by saying that 85% of Singaporeans own their own homes now this also is cognizant of the low income this is also because they're causing significant struggles because these are people who have used their entire savings for the CPF to pay for their own homes and they arrived at their pensions poor that's why we have people who are having to work into their 70s and 80s collecting a cardboard and tin cans because they have spent all their money on their house so we are a set secure but income insecure in Singapore precisely for the low income group ok we have just a quick a little while for for Josephine to respond a little and then we'll get to a new story well in my past five years as an MP I see residents every Tuesday evening and the concern over medical care I think of course has to be looked in the context of whether we are able to put in place a social safety net to help those who really need it and I can say for a fact that over that's five years there's not been one single person who was denied quality medical care because he could not afford it we have a meta file system in place if they are in need they can go and look for the medical social worker and they were okay with that we need to end this discussion part of the segment of Minister which had to respond to all the views that represented sulfa including Josephine's first the cost of new houses for first-time buyers is about 23% of incomes the cost of servicing be the flat that hasn't changed very much over time and it's significantly lower than Hong Kong and most other cities significantly lower than in fact the developed countries at large it is cheaper to own and serviced the mortgage on a house in Singapore than it is in any other developed country that's point one Josephine has mentioned medical costs our medifund scheme which is for the lowest income group those who are too poor to create the bills is being expanded so if you take medifund together with Medisave and then the Insurance Scheme MediShield we ensure that everyone will be able to get quality health care at an affordable cost and that's what all the international reviews recognises that Singapore delivers value for money in health care if you look at cities what really distinguishes Singapore because all cities are expensive what really distinguishes Singapore is that the middle end and the lower end of our society gets significant benefits from the government each year significantly more than the GST they peel and that's the whole idea of the GST the bulk of the GST is collected from the top forty percent of the population and foreigners and my new foreigners contribute a lot of GST and we use the benefits to help those at the lower end so if you talk about exempting food or any other essentials from GST you're really taking away a source of revenue we are getting made mainly from those at the upper end and foreigners and reducing our ability to help those at the low end so let's be straight low-income Singaporeans receive from the government each year far more than the amount they pay in GST they receive it through welfare they receive it - you save subsidies they receive it through extra bursaries from pre-school all the way up to university so we have to leave the issue of a cost of living there we need to move on to the next issue that of foreign workers which has already come up in parts now according to the same poll commissioned by today 7 in 10 voters are concerned with increased competition with foreigners for jobs for nearly 8 in 10 say the congestion on public transport is a concern so Lina you start up just now talking about cost of living with about the open immigration policy so I gather the foreigners the issue of foreigners would be an issue close to the heart of your party yes would you like to add to this well they shall foreigners in Singapore what does your party propose to do about the situation of immigration as when it comes to foreign workers that's how they'd be given that Singapore does need an amount of labour from outside Singapore but your party views that the open immigration policy is perhaps detrimental or harming Singapore yes it is harmful to Singapore because they take away our jobs you know in areas of job creation I think there should be a level playing field where you know there are this p.m. ETS you know can hold the data with s pass they can come in and they no need to pay CPF Soleri and whatever party proposed to do instead or my party proposed that or the government should set some sort of policy or some law to ensure that our workers get a job from the owners you were the government what would your party do well we meet that you meet the employers who are paying this this workers from foreign countries to top up the the salary of the our local Singaporeans because they save a lot on the you know the CPF
