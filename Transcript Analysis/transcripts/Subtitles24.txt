at 34 years old Nicosia is the youngest candidate to contest in the upcoming elections national solidarity party's secretary general go Ming sing introduce her as part of the party's fourth and final batch of new candidates as he unveiled the NSPS five-member marine purity Miss Nicosia has been the subject of much attention of the news broke that she will be going up against PAP is Miss teen paling during a media conference she responds to criticisms of a political immaturity and intentions to stand in marine parade okay we forgot your question I wouldn't say that I have had grassroots experience per se but I've been very involved in the community ever since I was in secondary school I used to volunteer regularly with a community service group and I would be I was a camp counselor to delinquent secondary school students and on top of that I also made regular house-to-house visits to deliver foodstuffs to the needy just to sidetrack this was actually when I had my first political awakening because when I visited a house I was surprised to see that there was an old lady who was she had a roof over her head but she didn't even have enough money to buy a meal and then angered me because yes we have provided food for her for that one day but what is going to happen to her the rest of the days and that was when I realized that you need policies to go down to the root of the matter and you cannot rely on organizations to do the job for you okay moving on so after that I went to junior college and you know I was always very actively involved in CCS I was in the secondary school band after that I continued with my van activities in junior college when I moved on to university I decided to take on a more nurturing role so what I did was I continued doing camp counseling because I believe that's the best way to integrate students into the community on top of that I also had an online publication in NUS there was independent of any stakeholders so this was called the campus observer I fronted a as the managing editor and from there I explored issues that were pertinent to the ground in NUS many people have questioned whether youth is liability in politics I like to disagree I feel that in politics you need a representation of different types of voices in Parliament you need to ensure that there is a diverse and well around the group of individuals who are coming together to speak on behalf of national interests so with that I would say that you know I want to stand up here at the candidate and I want to represent the voice the voices of young Singaporeans who feel that they want to stay in this country who want to have their voice heard but who have been epithet ik all this while because they feel powerless to make any real change and I want to change that I want to engage young Singaporeans in politics and policymaking it's not our intention right Murray parade we had the party as a whole as a higher level have been always interested in Manipuri for strategic reasons here as he is there walking the ground in McPherson for the past two years and so he really has a very intimate understanding of the ground and you will be ashamed if we were to let this GRC go uncontested the way it has for the past 20 years for me personally Murray period holds a lot of sentimental value because I spent most of my education there in thi jail in t KS s follow by BJC so I feel very there's a strong draw to the environment to the GRC itself and I hope to offer my Canada to the residents to show that I'm familiar with that concept and it needs okay oh that might say thank you I will address this question the title is meant as a personal account and I'm quite surprised to see that people are actually so keen to grand exam that they will dig up a post that is really very very old because I've seen a particular tweet for myself and it's something to do in congested traffic no if the traffic has been like at a standstill for an hour and you are running late for meeting wouldn't you be sorry - no I can see yes I'm from a middle-class family okay I say in affirmation b-flat so if that's down to income I eat at a coffee shop every day because that's the cheapest thing that I can afford I mean once you know why I do I'll go on my friends be a nicer places but you know I think with regards to being on the ground I understand how the average Singaporean feels because I myself I feel that I'm an average Singaporean I'm not elite I do not have you know a scholar I I don't know a scholarship background I was never like um I never met University overseas so I think with regards to the contents of the everyday Singaporean I understand how I feel I understand how it feels to send in a crowded train I understand how it feels to you know be stuck in congested traffic and or refer to my tweet yeah so I think yeah I do empathize I do empathize I think that politics in general is quite a tricky game especially for the opposition but one thing I'm very thankful for and I'm very thankful for and I think that you know it's important to have is a strong support system so our friends our families are from all the people who are rallying behind me online I think one thing I'm thankful for I said I've been raised in a culture that has always taught me to push the boundaries and to question the status quo so I think part of it led to me questioning the current state of policies you know yes they benefit Singaporeans as a whole but what about those who fall through the cracks it's a not being done for them and I think yeah I've very supportive parents yeah while you guys really recycling your questions okay I think that's a very tricky question to us a 24 year old I'm only 24 I cannot say that I've had a regret that it's so life-threatening they had stopped me in my tracks and made me unable to move forward so yes I would say that I have had many setbacks in life perhaps a few minor regrets here and there but I think as a whole every triumph every regret every telling you shed every part that you've chosen to take has developed you or rather developed me as a person okay my biggest strength I would say is that I'm very driven in a very committed and I'm very energetic so whenever I'm committed to a cause I see true and I have a very strong sense of justice so if I feel that there are people who are being treated unfairly if I feel that it has been an unfair distribution of resources I will want to be in there to step in and to be the doer you know to change things in stuff standing by the sidelines and complaining but we forgot to my weakness you know that could also translate to my weakness because I can get very very emotional about that so I don't think yeah I know I need to control their life then and that's it I'm also a professional eater sometimes so for those of you on my Facebook page if I have a reply to your comment I'm so sorry I will do it very soon I do not wish to compare myself to her I do not wish to focus on issues of trivial importance and I think that it's important that we focus on the pressing national issues at hand that will impact how voters make the decision in the coming elections
