so mo II looked at this the teach the school spoke to the teacher the teacher understood that this was beyond the limit because what do you live is your own thing but what you disseminate comes very close to promoting a lifestyle so spoke to him he took down his blog he posted an explanation he apologized for what he had done and he continues teaching in RI today so there is space there are limits de facto gays have a lot of space in Singapore we hold gay groups whole public discussions with rubbish websites I visited some of them there are films plays on gay teams in fact sometimes people asked why are there so many are the other subjects in the world but since we have allowed that the last few years maybe this is letting off pressure eventually we will find a better balance there are gay bars and clubs they exist we know where they are everybody knows where they are they don't have to go underground we don't have us gays the government does not act as moral police no and we don't proactively and force section 377 a on them but this doesn't mean that we have reached a blow of social consensus that this is a happy state of affairs because there are still very different views amongst Singaporeans on whether homosexuality is acceptable or morally right and we heard these views aired in Parliament over these last two days some are convinced passionately so that homosexuality is an abomination to quote professor Tod arm's words yesterday others probably many more uncomfortable with homosexuals more so with public display of homosexual behavior yet others are more tolerant and accepting there's a range of views there's also a range of degrees to which people are seized with this issue many people are not that sees with this issue and speaking candidly I think that people who are very seized with this issue are minority and the majority of Singaporeans well it is something which they are aware of but isn't not the top of their consciousness including I would say amongst a significant amount them a significant number of case themselves but also I would say amongst the Chinese speaking community in Singapore Chinese speaking Singaporeans they are not as strongly engaged either fall removing 377 a or against me removing 377 a their attitude is live and let live and so even in this debate these two days you will have noticed there have been very few speeches made in Parliament in Mandarin on this subject I know mr. BAE I am King made one this afternoon but Mr Lothian did not and it reflects the focus of the Chinese speaking ground and their mindsets so the for the majority of Singaporeans the attitude is a pragmatic one we live in let live the current legal position in Singapore reflects these social norms and attitudes as miss Indrani Raja and mr. Hari Kumar explained yesterday it is not legally neat and tidy with a high Kumar gave a very professional explanation of how untidy it is but it is a practical arrangement that has evolved up out of our historical circumstances we are not starting from a blank slate trying to design an ideal arrangement neither we're proposing new laws against homosexuality we have what we have inherited and how we what we have adapted to our circumstances and as mr. Kumar pointed out we inherited section 377 a from the British from imported from the English Victorian law Victorian from the period of Queen Victoria in the 19th century by the Indian Penal Code by the Strait settlement penal code into Singapore law Asian societies don't have such laws not in Japan not in China not in Taiwan but it's part of our landscape we've retained it over the years so the question is what do we want to do about it now do we want to do anything about it now if we retain it we're not enforcing it proactively nobody has argued for it to be enforced very vigorously in this house if we abolish it we may be sending the wrong signal that our circumstance has changed and the rules have shifted but because of the Penal Code amendments section 377 a has become a symbolic issue the the point for both opponents and proponents to tussle around the gay activists wants it removed those who are against gay values and lifestyle argue strongly to retain it and both sides have mobilized to campaign for their causes there was a petition to remove section 377 a it accumulated couple of thousand signatures which and was presented in this house then therefore there was a counter-petition to retain it which collected 15,000 signatures at least 22 newspapers I have encountered the signatures 15,000 15 5 6 0 signatures probably gone up since last we started speaking also with an open letter to me and the ministers and I we have received many emails and letters on this subject and I've received the emails too in my mailbox very well written all following a certain model answer style so it's a very well-organized campaign and not only writing letters but people constituents have visited MPs and meet the people sessions to see the MP not because there's anything they want done but to congratulate the empty on what a good government this is that we are keeping section 377 a and please stay a good government and please don't change it so I don't doubt the depth of the sentiments and the breadth of the support but it's also a very well organised pressure campaign but I'm not surprised that this issue is too contentious because even in the West even where they have liberalized homosexuality still remains a very contentious issue the decriminalized homosexual behave as decades ago in the 1960s 70s and they've gone a long way towards accepting gays in society they don't really have gays in a prominent places it's if you want to have a complete cabinet or complete lineup when you go for elections you must have some on your list so that you are seem to have been inclusive certainly so in Europe also through in America but still the issue is bitterly disputed so in America there are fierce debates over gay rights and same-sex marriages and the Conservatives in America are pushing back so President George Bush has been calling for constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman and not between a man and a man or a woman and a woman this is an America so the issue is still joined even within the churches it's a hot subject the Anglican Church Church of England the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams he had gave you he had liberal views on gay issues he became the archbishop he has moderated his views because he has a reflected Church as a whole and even within the church the church in England the church in America have a very serious disagreement with a church of with the Anglican churches in Asia and in Africa who almost split away on this issue of ordination of gay people as bishops and they've patched up a compromise recently in America and the Archbishop of Canterbury who's head of the church had to plead with his with a community to come to some understanding so that they maintain the Anglican Communion so this is not an issue where we can reach happy consensus and abolishing section 3 7 sir
