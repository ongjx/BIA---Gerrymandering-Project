you're with News five tonight the vigorous debate between prime minister lee sin lung and opposition leader lotte account went on for about ten minutes yes that's right mr. Lau told the house that members of the Workers Party have in their speeches make their position clear on national issues and that the opposition party has no intention of hiding itself in Parliament the reason why I decided to focus my speech on construction constructive politics because I thought there was an important issue that we should look at that's what I say in my speech Singapore is becoming more diversify there'll be different views and moving forward how the government would do and accommodate different views and different perspective as an opera is important for us to move forward together as one United people and the other MPs from the workers party will be talking about different issues you would they were covered I mean ranging from social issues social safety net to Foreign Affair national security they will cover the full range of areas and they by we speak our job our focus on constructive politics I thought it was an important issue and of course it's important to also understand what is the perspective our PAP in terms of constructive politics and from what the Prime Minister's say it seems to me that this mark instructor d-theta on the top of the PAP rather than constructive politics in terms of the society that's moving forward and I have a fun my endorsement to what the president I say that we should look at the outcome of constructive politics that is that we should be able to move forward together despite the differences next he's talking about the workers puppy pick topping on foreign workers issue I say again I don't think we have big plot I have explained in this house of some misunderstanding of the speeches they had big and in any case I also know that when the PAP have to make a policy u-turn they call it policy I don't know whether there is a sheep or is of people I think the record will speak for itself when we make a shift we acknowledge a shift when that workers party changes position they pretend they haven't that is a difference now as for delegating responsibility for different parts of a budget speech to a different MPs that entirely within mr. lotia camps prerogative it's not for me to suggest how he should conduct his affairs in the Workers Party but there's a leader you do have a responsibility to state where does the party stand on the big issue somebody can take out look after health care somebody can take care of transport somebody can spend all his time marking Minister Hanks we care on education but where do you stand on what the government is doing is the government doing right is it doing wrong do you agree with the government do you have a better view or do you abstain or do you abstain from abstaining our position is quite clear on many of these issues if the Prime Minister wanted my view on what the government has been doing and whether he has done well I'll say well we have soft some of the problems where the Prime Minister has mentioned and the Workers Party MP also acknowledged in your speech but also pointed out there are things that is still work in progress and and the governor will have to focus on and to make it better and to improve so that is the position and I don't see the for me to totally stand up I think their MPs will be able to do in our own view and to give their view and their assessment and at the same time wherever possible offer certain views and alternative subjection to improve the policies I'm very grateful for the extremely reasonable explanation from the member I hope he takes an equally reasonable approach when he comes to election rallies because the Workers Party approach has been to be extremely reasonable indeed low-profile in Parliament but come election time to turn into Tigers and heroes for praising the workers party's ability to fight in the elections we have no intention to hire or so in Parliament we seek the Bandit for people to come to Parliament to check against the government and we have done the honestly and sincerely we have not turned this place into into a theater that shows we are responsible we will behave continuously as a rational and responsible party and it members would I believe members who agreed the Workers Party has been rational we are not come here with some war policies or worse objections we debate the policies we came up with some suggestions but these are not bankrupting the government offer or suggesting to use a visa election I think we also rational we don't accuse the PAP of something that you cannot substantiate or I know we can sue so I think we're fine and election is elections and I thank the Minister for publishers for noting that we can finally I'm sure that we happy tend to you are the government and you have been the governing path for 50 years so you've got more much people telling the people than the Workers Party how can you say that we are tiger we are something else in Parliament I'm sure the PAP can equally be bygones he's an eloquent explanation for why the Workers Party has been inarticulate about many things in a serious Parliament the government presents its policies the opposition presents its alternatives the Workers Party may not have alternatives on every issue you may not have a full range of all the complexities of designing an HDTV scheme or MediShield scheme you do have a responsibility to say which direction are we going and that direction has to be said clearly not to explain to the PAP but to explain to Singaporeans what you stand for and what you stand for cannot be what the PP is doing and a little bit better that means you have no stand wherever the PAP is standing ask them to do better that's easy I can do that too but where do you stand where are we totally wrong where do you think this is a completely different way to do things better where do you think in principle we do not want Singapore to be like this these are big issues which deserve to be debated and not delighted over and avoided in the house and that is what a first world Parliament should be about now see that the Prime Minister is reasonable to say that the Workers Party may not have come up be able to come we ought alternative policy that's true but to say that the Workers Party has no position a major issue that is not true I think we did state our position in Parliament with debate with the beta major policy vigorously we didn't oppose other policies but where we think that there is a need for us to oppose adding concern the future of Singapore like the population white paper we do so so with the opposition on important issues we didn't oppose four things that we think are doing right he said not in love I think he is useful to bring it down to something very specific let's come back to the population white paper during the debate the position taken by the Workers Party is that enough is enough zero growth we have continued to grow I have not heard the Workers Party demand zero growth today do you still demand that or do you now think that we should allow SMEs to survive in Singapore we had made a calculation at a point time of debating the population white paper and we continue to allow the following workers to grow we were it will be untenable in the future generations feature population growth and they buy we decided that we need to keep the population number in check and one way of doing it of course is to freeze the foreign workers growth in number our calculation was that probably between that existing number of the foreign worker you can still move around with some sectors I mean only so much of foreign worker and thereby you can still get by with the zero population zero foreign workers grow we understand perfectly the possibility and the trade-off there is our position at a point in time we have not objected subsequently or grieve the government fault why are not doing it because that's our view there is zero population growth but the government decided otherwise there's a way of doing it we have said our piece but we have to respect the decision or a government to move on but our message has got across we cannot sub same continuously the kind of population grow plan the government is our planning and I'm glad to hear today that you know promised are saying that we are the government is the king of a serious view or tightening and watching the grow up population to all this complicated TEDx when I don't know whether missile audience still stands by what was said in Parliament in the whitepaper debate last year because if he really does after all the explanation he should say we have too many foreign workers now sent home 70,000 then we will know where he stands but after telling me that you can massage this and some people can do less and others can do and we'll need more that's easy to say who's going to do the massaging of course the government and that is the mark of a substandard opposition I disagree this is of a substance substandard position this is the mud of an OP responsible position not a gem of the government allowing the government after giving our view debating it allowing the government to move forward not to jam up the government so it is a map of responsible government and a map of first war Parliament we have to call a spade a spade if you have changed the position and your previous position was wrong Cecil if you hold by opposition have your guts to reaffirm it and take their consequences but to weasel the way play with words avoid the issue and then claim to be responsible that is what we fear can drive Singapore's politics into the same place where every many other countries have gone and that's a wrap of the big story then best debates in Parliament today the sitting continues tomorrow Thank You Sharon
