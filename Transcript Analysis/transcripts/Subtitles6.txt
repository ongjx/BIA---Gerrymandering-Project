yes Thank You speaker I'm actually my clarifications on the similar point that mr. Murali raised because I think earlier a minister in his round up speech said that the returning officer could allow election departs to be paying cash if for example the electronic transfer failed so is that the only circumstance you know when care should be accepted meaning that there was some problem with the internet or electronic transfer because it does seem to send another barrier for candidates who may be raising money up to the very last minute and may not be able to do the funds electronically so I will ask Minister to give some indication that the returning officer should accept cash unless there's a very good reason why an accounting of any Yui care should not be accepted is because - in answer to both mr. Morales and mr. Williams question yes we hope that the primary mode will go towards the a pavement the transactions but in saqqaq extenuating circumstances as you have mentioned whereby you know the electronic payment system fail then we are able to accept cash oh you have last minute you are talking about crowdsourcing the last minute crop sourcing right so if there are extenuating circumstances I think you let the returning officers know and they will exercise the discussion meaning that actually um the failure of the electronic transfer is not a prerequisite that means to say there could be other circumstances why they could not do the electronic transfer
