vulnerable members thank you for your support your kind words and for electing me as a temp Speaker of Parliament since our first legislative assembly I would also like to thank the members of the public who have expressed support for my nomination when announcement came out just under a week ago indeed many were surprised and it sparked off some discussion about the role of the speaker it's not a bad thing we do need fellow Singaporeans to be involved to gain a deeper understanding of not just the role of the speaker but also that of Parliament its proceedings and how all of us here contribute to making Singapore better home for people as members of parliament whatever all stripes we need to be accessible we need to be relevant we need to be real we need to present the voices and needs of our individual constituents but we need also to stand for a united Singapore to speak with one voice in a visit first of all the business of parliament is multifarious in the first session of Parliament in December 1965 we saw the presentation of bills that ensure Singapore's independence as well as the first budget which assured her defence it also oversaw bills on the care of orphans and widows destitute persons as well as the incorporation of the Singapore Asian seaman's club incorporation ordinance members will also know that in that session the Barisan socialists which is the main opposition force in Singapore then had boycotted Parliament among other things they said that this was because Parliament was giving legal seal to our departure from Malaysia which they saw as a neo-colonialist plot to divide and rule they also saw it as legal cover for our abuse of public funds and as a platform for propaganda to cheat the people and confuse them today the Berenstain is no more but opposition voices are well represented and part paid fully we have six members of the Workers Party reformed the Baris unmerge in 1988 free Workers Party non constituency MP as well as nine nominated members of parliament in a parliamentary democracy the legitimacy of the laws we enact rests on the scrupulous attention we on both sides of the house pay to the reason debate which accompanies the passing of each law no one doubts that our goal in these sittings must be to advance the interests of all Singaporeans I therefore see the presence of our opposition colleagues here in the House today as a strength and a positive step towards constructive contestation of ideas such contestation will become even more complex in the future why well we live in an era where information flows almost unbounded and in copious volume the world continues to change with ever accelerating speed we feel uncertain the challenge therefore is to discern to sense make to find clarity and ultimately to provide direction the term fake news is oxymoronic because fake news is not news but lies putting on a sheep's coat does not make these false who true but yet we have seen time and again across the wall how misinformation can have serious impact on people's lives at the same time new platforms allow people's views to be channel very directly to our leaders very involved discourse is also taking place outside this house as people are more aware they are more informed this is the environment in which we operate therefore to be effective we do need to engage beyond this house to tap on the collective wisdom there lies without what we all need to be grounded and engaged let us be clear the buck stops here we need to be the institution that channels and reflects the voices of the people so that we can query answer and debate in a manner that provides hope and clarity we need to be a beacon from where Singaporeans can take reference with confidence when addressing and understanding issues that matter greatly for collective well-being to be this beacon and to do this well we need to gain the trust and the respect of the public we therefore need to uphold the honor and dignity of this house in the way we conduct our proceedings I want to facilitate good free-flowing debate vigorously by the same time maintain mutual respect do not abuse our parliamentary privileges and to keep to the standing orders I will be impartial and fair but I will also be firm now before I Anne allow me to say a few words about my predecessor first my sincere and deep thanks to madam Halima Yakov for her generosity and advice and support as I assume this appointment she has more than enough on her plate at the moment but as this is typical of her she has made time for me in her diet in the diary she is a woman that she is and for that I'm grateful last but not least I look forward to working alongside all of you as your speaker earlier I had referred to that first session of Parliament in 1965 at the time the first Finance Minister mr. Lim Kim Sun recounted the loss of seventy million dollars in revenue as a result of our independence no small amount for Singapore since our total budget at the time was only 205 million dollars but the Prime Minister then recounted it cheap as a price of independence and he said be that as it may perhaps it was our good fortune that you get a circumstance where someone with an antique gold sovereign goes and exchange it for a bag full of sweets and who are we to explain when we have found ourselves the proper Sasser of an antique gold piece we today remain the possessor of this peace which we have burnished to a shine and multiplied several times over our focus is and must be to ensure that these gold pieces work better for Singaporeans for Singapore for today and compound it in force for all our tomorrow's thank you
