mr. speaker sir I rise in support of the motion the President's speech marks the formal opening of the Parliament session the speech itself describes the government's agenda for the rest of the term the agenda to the speech then lay out the specific programs of each ministry this is a tradition we inherited from the UK where the Queen delivers a speech drafted by the elected government although it's called the Queen's speech and the speech highlights the government's legislative programme however our president's speech this year is slightly different it sets out not only the programme for the current term but also longer-term priorities beyond this term of government the speech took this approach because Parliament is reopening at a special moment in our history the world situation is very uncertain the global order which is based on openness globalization and free trade has come under great pressure relations between the big powers especially the US and China and also the US and Russia are under stress it is not clear whether the institutions and the international rules that have underpinned world peace and security for the last few decades will change and if they change there will be significant long-term implications for Singapore Singapore too is at a turning point we are opening a new chapter after sg50 it will be a new phase of our social and economic development we have the responsibility and the privilege of reimagining and rebuilding Singapore over the next 50 years and more we are also going through a significant generational change a new generation born long after independence is coming to the fore with different views and aspirations we are also in the midst of a political transition with a fourth generation ministers preparing to take over within the next few years therefore it's timely for the government to set out a broader vision a longer-term agenda in the president speech I asked the four G ministers to draft the president speech because they will have to carry out this agenda continuing beyond my time as Prime Minister I gave my inputs and I endorsed what they produce because s p.m. I'm still ultimately responsible for the government's agenda but my main role is to be supportive to help the four G ministers present and implement the agenda and to see through as much of it as possible while I am p.m. today I'll speak about five aspects of the President's speech first coping with external challenges next growing our economy third ensuring social mobility fourth maintaining social cohesion and finally ensuring good politics and leadership let me start with the external environment globalization which has delivered growth and stability for many countries including Singapore has come under pressure countries particularly in the West are questioning the benefits of openness and free trade and of the free movement of people the US has been thus far the champion and sponsor of the post-war international system they promoted free trade they opened their own doors to immigrants they were generous to others sharing technology and know-how they spent blood and treasure to maintain global peace they believed that all this was in their own enlightened self-interest but now many Americans no longer believe this including the Trump administration they feel that other countries are benefitting more from the global system and benefiting at the expense of the u.s. we want to make sure that the US will always benefit directly item-by-item country by country and not just generally from upholding a system which is good for everybody and therefore indirectly good for the u.s. so the US has made trade a top issue especially trade with China the trade tensions between US and China hurt business but more broadly their unilateral and tit-for-tat actions undermine the multilateral trading system in other words it's not just that two participants who are affected or the amount of whether it's steel or aluminum or soya beans or cars which is not exported and which can't be traded but the whole multilateral system the system of rules which ensures that countries big and small have played on a level playing field have their place in the Sun and can contribute to and benefit from this international network of cooperation and is a system which we have depended upon in Singapore therefore the trade tensions threaten global prosperity especially for smaller countries like Singapore the trade disputes can also affect the overall relations between the powers the US and China are jockeying for position and advantage the u.s. is still strong especially militarily but China is growing in power influence and confidence increasingly the US has to accommodate China and if there's mutual distrust and rivalry between the two it is about a small step from a trade agreement trade disagreement to a wider and more serious quarrel the US and China are far from going to war with each other but it is not clear which way their relations will tilt if they tilt towards more conflict it will be bad be bad not only for the two powers but for the rest of the world as well that's obvious but if relations tilt to the other extreme and the two powers agreed to divide up the world between them and set rules that only benefit them that would be just as detrimental especially for small countries which have no see as a small and open country Singapore will always be vulnerable to what happens around us as miss Lee Kuan Yew used to say when elephants fight the grass suffers but when they make love the grass suffers also therefore we must be aware of what's happening around us and prepare ourselves for changes and surprises close to home Malaysia saw historic change last week in his general election bakudan harapan led by a tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad now forms the government for the first time ever in Malaysia the ummno led Barisan Nasional lost power this is a momentous development as militias closest neighbor we need to play close attention to our relationship with them the two countries have deep historical economic and people-to-people ties we hope Malaysia is stable and prosperous we've enjoyed good relations with Malaysia under the former Prime Minister Najib Razak and cooperated on major projects that benefit both sides we have also worked with Dr Mahathir and several of his team before we completed joint projects with Malaysia when Dr Mahathir was last the Prime Minister including building the second link at plus and I also know mr. annoy Brahim well because he was my counterpart when I was Deputy Prime Minister the expectations of a new Malaysian government are very high and I think Dr Mahathir will be very busy in the days to come but I plan to visit Malaysia on Saturday to meet of the Mahathir and to tell him that I look forward to working with him again for mutual benefit Indonesia is having elections to local elections this year and national elections the next I have good working relations with President jokowi as I did with President Yudhoyono before I hope we can maintain friendly and productive ties with Indonesia - regardless of political cycles or election outcomes we will work hard on with our two neighbors their success makes for a more peaceful and prosperous region and that is good for us in the president speech she spoke about how Singapore must remain a nation of opportunities this to me is the heart of our nation building journey our forefathers came to this land because they sought better lives for themselves in their families when independence was thrust upon us and the odds were stacked against us our pioneer generation Dagon and slob to build a nation their children and grandchildren took up the torch after them and improved Singapore year by year this sense of opportunity of possibility hope is the spark that has inspired generations of Singaporeans to dream big and to work hard to realize those dreams we must always sustain this confidence that we can build a better life for ourselves and future generations of Singaporeans that we can make tomorrow better than today nationally this means growing our economy creating new possibilities and expanding our horizons individually it means improving the life of every Singaporean in a fair and open and a cohesive society one of the top priorities of the government is therefore to keep the economy growing we're in a strong position today because our economy has grown steadily for the past 50 years and more we've enjoyed high growth for much of this half-century even from time to time exceeding 10% per annum since independence in 1965 our GDP has grown more than 40 times in real terms today our per capita income is higher than Japan's we can see in all our lives now that we have become more developed our growth forecast is moderated to two to four percent this has made some people anxious they worry that their children will not have better lives then they themselves do today but let me put the numbers in perspective first 2 to 4 percent is in fact quite good for mature economy South Korea and Taiwan are growing around this rate - Japan is growing even slower second 2 to 4 percent is just an estimate based on our current stage of economic development it is not the limit to our efforts or to our ambitions individual companies and individual industries can certainly do better especially if they come up with a new more innovative product or if they expand into new markets till virgin ground we are pushing ahead with our economic upgrading we can see the opportunities the only question is whether we can seize them take for example the digital economy a lot is happening around us in Indonesia in Jakarta the tech scene is vibrant buzzing with energy and talent and Indonesia has produced for unicorns unicorns are not animals there are companies which have become worth more than 1 billion and Indonesia has four of them gorgeou travel oka boo kalapa and tokopedia Vietnam Thailand and Malaysia have lively tech sectors - so if we can build up our own tech sector while connecting with us we will prosper together we are making good progress also developing frontier technologies in artificial intelligence in tech in advanced manufacturing we've attracted leading AI researchers and companies to Singapore NTU has built a reputation as a leading Centre in AI the Alibaba Group recently opened a Research Institute on AI together with NTU which is its first Research Institute outside China when I visited Beijing recently I went to see PD juicing it's the equivalent of grab or uber and I met some NTU graduates a and the TT CTO chief technology officer Bob Chang told me the graduates are doing very well so our people are well prepared in FinTech mas has developed Singapore to become a fin tech hub just within the last two or three years the right rules the right encouragement the right openness the right light touch and the flower blossoms they have green fingers more than 400 FinTech firms are now based here and so are over 30 innovation labs and research centers set up by MNCs in advanced manufacturing a-star is collaborating with multinationals with local companies and universities to develop new technologies in aerospace and precision engineering for example we have a joint laboratory with rolls-royce and Singapore aero engine services that was open last year and these will create these projects will create good manufacturing jobs and SMEs will benefit and so will workers because through these research collaborations they will get access to the new technologies so there are many possibilities for us to grow our economy and to reinvent and redevelop Singapore but growth alone is not enough individual Singaporeans must see progress in their lives must feel that the future is bright and must know that each one of us has our stake in it and this means sharing growth widely and equitably to improve the lives of all Singaporeans it also means fully maximizing the talents and efforts of our people and getting the most capable pianned reliable people into the most consequential jobs where they can make the most difference and the greatest contribution in other words making sure there's social mobility so that our meritocracy continues to work how do we know if our meritocracy is working well first of all every tile must have a good start in life regardless of which family you were born into secondly every talent has to be recognized and developed to the fullest thirdly every opportunity has to be open to anyone with the right attitude and ability and finally a capable person must face minimal social impediments minimal social impediments to being accepted to contribute to be in a position to lead in society and in the long term this last part keeping the social impediments down is the most difficult to sustain we want Singapore society to maintain an informal and egalitarian tone where people interact freely and comfortably as equals and there are no rigid class distinctions or barriers that keep good people down this is important but it is beyond the government's ability to bring about alone Society itself has to be open and permeable each one of us must carry those attitudes those value those norms that willingness to welcome talent welcome ability to keep the system the way it is any society which has been stable for a long time tends to stratify and it becomes less socially mobile for example the UK and India have long entrenched hierarchies and very fixed notions of class or in India caste which they have found very difficult to overcome Singapore is still a young country of 50 years and notions of class and hierarchy have not yet calcified our social queues our markers our norms they're still evolving and we don't want them to evolve in the wrong direction and contribute to caste divisions and rigidities social cues are important because they become they can become ways to pigeonhole or to exclude others knowingly or unknowingly in Britain your accent the way you speak can define your status in society do you have a posh public school accent do you speak like a professional who's been to Oxbridge do you speak as a working-class person with a local accent regional accent do you speak cockney twang then you know you come from a certain part of London and you are a certain class of person not very high up the totem pole so George Bernard Shaw an Englishman's way of speaking absolutely classifies him classifies him it's a pun it pigeonholes him into his social class you listen to him you know do you respect him do you look down on him do you give him orders or do you say yes sir and he went on to say absolutely classifies him the moment he talks he makes some other Englishmen despise him and it's true if we don't have an upper-class accent your markdown straight away and that is why Singapore schools put emphasis on teaching students who speak good English otherwise those children whose parents already speak good English at home will be fine but others will grow up at a permanent disadvantage and without everyone being proficient speaking standard English Singlish will become a class marker in other words if you can't speak proper English while you are down there if you can't speak proper English the doors opened for you and I think this would close the doors on many from less privileged families and that's why MCI continues to have campaigns to teach people to speak proper English there are other social markers that can signal an entrenched class differences members may recall the recent fasts over an unauthorised secondary school social studies textbook guidebook it contained a table that had sweeping generalizations about people in Singapore from high and low social economic statuses SES for instance supposedly low SES speaks English play soccer or basketball and eat at hawker centres while high SES speak formal English play golf or tennis and only eat at fine restaurants the story went viral many Singaporeans were appalled and rightly so luckily it was not a guidebook approved by a mooie lifestyle choices can indeed become separators in society distinguishing marks what you eat how you dress where you go for holidays what games you play what clubs you belong to in every society people have ways to show who is in and who's out you take one look at a person or you listen to him to fall moment and you can already place him there are distinctions in Singapore society too but the general tone in Singapore is one of restraint if you wear chunky gold watch and dressed flashily instead of being impressed people may think you are alone shocked and that is as it should be we must discourage people from flaunting their social advantages we should frown upon those who go for ostentatious displays of wealth and status or worse look down on others less well-off and privileged we should emphasize our commonalities not accentuate our differences and so you see if you look around the chamber everybody in formally dressed discussing serious matters of state in any other parliamentary chamber in this part of the world or anywhere in the world we'll all be talked up in our Sunday best just to show that we are somebody in society but that's not the Singapore way there's a further obstacle to social mobility elite groups who become closed circles preventing outsiders from getting in every society has it elite they occupy the key leadership positions in society in government in academia in business in professions in politics members of the elite share similar backgrounds interests social spaces they may be alumni of the same schools they may have done business with on another they may have worked in the same professions there they know one another they have interacted with one another in different roles over long periods through their lives such networks are natural structures in society they are useful for people to get know to know one another to get things done informally to share an implicit understanding of the interests of their society and to feel a collective sense of responsibility for the society and such networks are an important part of our social capital but social networks must always remain open and permeable they must not close up they must not form glass ceilings it must not be difficult or impossible for others with talent or ability but lacking the right backgrounds and connections to be welcomed into the elite group to rise to the top to take their rightful place and make their full contribution if this happened not only with social mobility be frustrated but soon the elite group would start to only look after its own interests and fail in their duty to lead and to care for the rest of the society and that would be disastrous for Singapore let me share something which only can't told me recently RI raffles institution is one of our most popular schools I didn't go to RI but I can tell you it's a good school it has a strong tradition of accepting students from diverse backgrounds so long as they make the cut but over the years RI has become less diverse the new RI principal has been putting in the effort speaking to parents of potential students and primary schools across Singapore to encourage them to apply to RI to his surprise some of the parents told him they didn't want to send their child why not because they thought their child couldn't cope with the academic demands but because they feared he wouldn't be able to fit in with other more well-off students actually I think this fear is unfounded because in reality RI students do come from varied backgrounds and just over half of the students live in public housing 53% and all of the students get along confidently and comfortably and bursaries and scholarships are readily available so no parent needs to worry that he can't afford to send his child to RI or that his child will feel out of place but if such a perception exists and discourages promising students from applying to the school is not good for RI is not good for Singapore and I knows what it has to do in order to uphold its egalitarian tradition MOU will work with them and other popular schools too so that these schools never become self-perpetuating closed circles government policies and programs must and do support social mobility and meritocracy we make sure the fundamentals are done well quality education home ownership and affordable health care which improve the lives of every Singaporean we give everyone a good education and now we're investing heavily in preschool to give all Singaporean kids in fact almost babies as well a good start in life we have a strong social safety net with targeted assistance schemes so that those the difficulties are not left behind and forgotten and we intervene with extra help we're than education housing health care our jobs training for those who need it to enable them to take full advantage of the opportunities above all our education system must stay open we've set aside places in primary schools for children without affiliation to these schools and we will do more of necessary we are expanding opportunities for students from different schools to interact through sports community activities and the outward-bound school last year I visited the outward-bound school for their 50th anniversary celebrations I had attended the course 50 years I chatted with Nicholas concezio who's the executive director of OBS and I told them that when I went to OBS 50 years ago as a 15 year old they only took in two students per secondary schools so in a group of hundred and thirty-odd there were people from 5060 different schools different language streams very different social backgrounds and we all had to get together because they mixed us up properly and we went to the course together we became good friends and came away understanding the diversity of our society better and how we could all work together because 17 days at that impressionable age it's an intense experience we are put through physically stressed you're emotionally put to your limits you have to work with others there's very little that you can do alone and we don't make friends you are miserable and you have to make friends across boundaries so I recounted this and Nicolas told me that today well because of the larger numbers they can't take in students from 60 or 70 schools at a time but they take in students from two or three schools at a time and nowadays the students all speak English but still he finds clear differences in their culture self and interests of the students from the different schools and even in the way they use language so is all speaking English but different interests different vocabulary really different world perspectives almost an obvious the students still learn to work in teams so when they pitch a tent or build a raft or safely belay someone on an obstacle course they must work closely with team mates you can't do it alone and so the students learn to bridge their differences and to trust one another so after 50 years OBS remains a valuable opportunity for students to mix an entire across different schools and social groups and we will do more of this so we're building an extension of OBS on Coney Island when that opens even more students will benefit from this experience so we are doing many things to improve social mobility but I have to be honest with you there are no easy solutions many societies have faced this problem many ideas have been proposed and tried out political philosophers statesmen all powerful human minds have been brought to bear to try to deal with this conundrum of how to keep your society spry open stable and there have been no magic bullets there have been varying degrees of success and the most successful models perhaps are the Scandinavian countries but even they have seen widening social inequality in recent times so we have to understand that this is what they call a wicked problem it's a problem with no easy solution which we will discuss rightly repeatedly in this house through the years our strategy in Singapore has been more successful than most with universal education with home ownership with the government's determination to widen opportunities and make the most of every citizen we've made meritocracy work in Singapore and now that our society is more settled we must work harder to keep the pathways open and to level people up the government is not ideological we are pragmatic we will try anything which works we will learn from our own experience and the experience of others but we must also be realistic spot what looks promising but please also recognize what will not work some people have suggested I read in the newspapers a universal basic income which ins is a neat idea so far unproven anywhere in the world the Finns tried it and aborted the experiment early it didn't work for them others want to abolish the PSLE now that is in fact very hard to do educators have very different views and even parents have very different views whether it's PSLE you'd be better off without the PSLE but we are taking the first steps to change the status quo by doing away with tea scores and if anyone can come up with a better alternative certainly we will consider in the end the government must focus on practical effective policies as a society we must uphold clear social norms that minimize social barriers and encourage mobility so as to keep our meritocratic system working well for all Singaporeans meritocracy is about individuals having opportunities and being successful but we must also be successful together as one people one society and one nation not just successful alone but successful together and that's what social cohesion is about we must feel a sense of social responsibility and concern for our fellow citizens without which our society cannot hold together what holds us together is not our pink n RI C's but the shared experiences that we build together over time we grew up together National Schools we are comfortable around each other regardless of our family backgrounds we go through national service building brotherhood and camaraderie when we march and fight together we eat at Hawker centers regardless whether we are rich and poor so the guidebook is wrong we live in HDB estates we learn the habits and preferences of different races and religions and we help neighbors out when they are in need we travel together on public transport and unlike in some other countries there's no social stigma to living in public housing or taking the bus or the train we celebrate our successes together such as sg50 recently and every national day and when crisis hit we go through them side by side we've made much progress in our nation building we are now much more cohesive than 50 years ago when we didn't live in integrated HTTP States townships nor did we do ns together or even 20 years ago before 9/11 and before SARS but nation-building will always be a work in progress because the forces that pull Singaporeans in different directions never go away race language and religion are enduring fault lines from the start we knew they could divide and destroy us today our social cohesion has grown stronger but these tidal pools have grown stronger too take for example the influence of China and India on our own ethnic groups on Singaporean Indians and Chinese Singaporeans and Indian Singaporeans these are too vast nations even civilizations they are growing in strength and confidence it will be a very long time before we we become immune to their ethnic cultural or economic poles furthermore the relationship is complicated because on the one hand we want to maintain our separate identity as a multiracial sovereign independent country but on the other hand we want to say we speak Mandarin we have overseas Indians we have ethnic links we have cultural ties we have an inside track so between the two there's a tension and we have to keep that balance and maintain our position and our cohesion likewise with the Malays over time a Singapore and Malaya identity has emerged clearly but still it overlaps with the Malays in Malaysia both in terms of race as well as religion and the call for a global Ummah a community of the Muslims around the world has powerful appeal furthermore we are exposed in this Internet age to extremists and exclusivist teachings these can lead individuals are straight and if there's a terrorist attack it will cause great fear and distrust between Muslims and other Singaporeans beyond race language and religion we must work at building bridges between different groups and society in society traditionally when we talk about social cohesion we think of race language and religion but they be located in other dimensions there are other gradients other possible fault lines other ways where we have to strengthen our social cohesion and become closer together one of them is between unions and management another one is between all citizens and new the labor movement is one institution vital to our social cohesion because of the tripartite partnership labor-management relations are so source of strength for us unlike in many other countries where unions and management's are bitterly opposed whereas in Singapore labor harmony is secured with the help of a strong ntuc as we sing at every May Day rally slightly out of tune but in the new economy fewer workers are doing jobs traditionally covered by the trade unions and many more freelancers and professionals so these new groups are left out and union coverage shrinks as a result of the changing workforce composition and you have more people who are not represented not taken care of don't feel protected and look for other solutions it would weaken try part ISM and our social compact so it's better for the labour movement to embrace them to adopt their concerns to become more inclusive and that's what time to nsync did in until you see widening the labor movement membership beyond trade unions to include empty you see you associates the P Mets and the freelancers and now in teaming in an TOC will carry on his work another bridge we need to build is to our new citizens immigrants are part and parcel of our history and our identity and if you look ahead we need a steady flow of immigrants not too many not to feel just right to top up our population first-generation immigrants into any country will always take time to settle down to understand the nuances of the culture and character to progressively integrate into the society and that's what happens in the past with previous wait waves of first-generation Singaporeans over the last 200 years and that is a necessary process which has to happen as we continue to have an inflow of people to join us and become Singapore citizens the new arrivals have chosen to make Singapore their home and they will contribute to our country our society they have to make every effort to mix and to interact with everyone else for our part we should welcome them we should support them in their journey to become Singaporeans as others have helped our forefathers and help ourselves therefore there's much work to do to maintain our social cohesion mr. speaker sir these are the challenges for the next generation of leaders to continue to grow Singapore reinventing our economy creating new possibilities for the future to ensure that Singapore's always a land of opportunity a meritocratic fair and just society to hold Singaporeans together in one cohesive society can the next generation of leaders build on our shared experiences of 50 years and maintain the sense of collective mission can be worked to improve the lives of Singaporeans and not the lives of all Singaporeans and not the interests of nano groups so that they pass on an even stronger and more United Singapore I think they can the 4G team is now in place they're overseeing their own portfolios and projects they're explaining their ideas to Singaporeans they're implementing policies and making them work many of them joined in the last three general elections from 2006 onwards so but over the last 12 years I have also promoted promising backbenchers to become office holders including in a recent reshuffle it's a strong team of able men and women with a balanced combination of skills and strengths they are gaining experience they are willing to serve and most importantly their hearts in the right place we need new leaders for each generation from each generation because each generation has its own challenges to tackle and tough choices to make the electorate will be different the economic landscape will be different the international order may well also be different some hard truths will always remain for Singapore but even all problems may need new solutions we must be pragmatic and not ideological in our approach keep an open mind and make decisions both with the head and the heart remember our history but don't be trapped by it and that's why leadership renewal is crucial new ideas new bonds and new connections are needed with every new generation last week added reopening of Parliament I had a chance to chat with mr. Lou Tae Kyung somebody snapped a picture of us and the Workers Party posted a smiling photo of two of us on their Facebook page it was a nice picture what were we talking about I think mr. lo won't mind me sharing I asked him the Workers Party is having a leadership transition to what will change now that the wp has a new leader and he replied nothing much we the wp have our role these things should not change suddenly don't you agree I agreed with mr. Lou as an opposition party the Workers Party plays a role in our political system whoever is their party leader opposition parties keep Singapore politics contestable in other words the ruling party the PAP does not have a monopoly of power does not have the right to rule Singapore indefinitely so long as the PAP government performs it keeps a vote to support it stays in power and the opposition cannot gain ground but if the PAP government becomes incompetent or corrupt then of course the opposition will grow so our system gives the PAP government gives any government every incentive to perform and to keep the opposition performing its role where it is namely in the opposition the PAP is determined to perform we treat every election as a serious contest we take every debate in the house seriously and that's why we amended the Constitution to ensure that there will be always at least 12 opposition and NCM peace in the house whatever the outcome of the general election political parties do not have a fixed lifespan a time to live and a time to die as Ecclesiastes might put it how long a political party continues in government or in opposition for that matter because parties come and go in opposition to depends whether it can renew itself continue to serve the people continue to bring progress to the nation if the PAP can keep on successfully doing that we can stay in government but if we ever fail we deserve to lose so my message to all PAP end pieces work hard serve the people hold the ground win the elections this doesn't mean that government will shy away from difficult problems the government must government must govern and if ministers are not prepared to govern then give it up because that's your duty that's what you're here for and governing means that from time to time you have to do difficult things when they become necessary leadership means that you've got to explain persuade convince people that you know what you are doing and that you are doing it for good reason and it's the right thing to do that's the way to maintain people's trust and Trust is crucial take taxes in the recent Malaysian election one hot issue was their GST the previous government had introduced the new GST tax three years ago and it had caused great unhappiness in Malaysia after Pakatan harapan won the election Dr Mahathir announced that his new government would abolish the GST why did this happen it wasn't because of the economic merits or demerits of the GST from the economic point of view the GST is better than the sales tax that it replaced but politically Malaysians linked the GST with other complaints they had with that with a previous government and they rejected the explanations and the persuasions and they said no I don't accept this I'll prove it does that mean that no government should ever raise taxes alas that's not the real world from time to time the country will need to spend more on health care on defense on education or something else and if revenues are not enough it will have no choice but to raise taxes then the government must convince the population that is raising taxes for a good reason for the right reason and whether the voters accept that will depend not just on the arguments but also crucially on whether they trust the government because when the arguments for every right argument you can produce five doubtful ones which look quite plausible and during elections there is no shortage of producers of such arguments and people can get confused finally they have to decide whom do they trust what is the track record do you want to put your future your fate your children's future in the hands of this team and believe that they have your best interests at heart and if you do you vote for them and you take all the things which need to be done as one bundle finally voters have to trust the government to do the right thing on their behalf even when it is painful I think this is the right lesson to learn without trust the government can't govern it wouldn't dare to do painful but necessary things and politics becomes the art of pandering a bidding war between the parties who can give more who can offer more you say you reduce the tax I say I abolish the tax then you say I will give you a home power on top of that and how to pay well we can think about that after the elections and the country goes downhill the 4G ministers understand this they've been working together learning to complement one another strengths and weaknesses making decisions as a team and taking collective responsibility for these decisions to me this working together is as important if not more important than the question of who will be the next PM because for the next PM I know there's more than one qualified candidate we are fortunate that this is so because it provides strength and depth to the team now is about the team coming to a consensus on the best option but to work together as a team that is not a choice because there's no other option whoever becomes the next PM the team has to work closely together for him to succeed and if they cannot or do not do so then the next PM will fail whoever he is even in the best of times and certainly in times of severe crisis mr. Lee Kuan Yew did not run the country by himself neither did mr. Goh chok Tong nor myself when mr. Lee one year Wassily received the freedom of the City of London in 1982 it was a grand occasion they dressed up he made a speech he said I feel like a conductor at a concert bowing to applause but unable to turn around and invite the accomplished musicians in his orchestra to rise and receive the ovation for the music they have played for running a government is not unlike running an orchestra and no Prime Minister ever achieves much without an able team of players I think I can speak for mr. mr. Goh chok Tom when I say that we both feel the same way all three of us were not sole leaders but Primus inter pares that means first amongst equals by the emphasis is we are equals but you're just the first amongst equals first amongst equals with our colleagues we take their views we take them seriously we benefit from their advice and their abilities and their skills we have fierce arguments as to what to do but we are honest strong on a team together with strong enough bonds that we can deal with issues together and there's leadership but it is unforced it has to be unforced leadership the team accepts respects and knows that it has an important role to play they are not there just to carry out orders we were all fortunate Singapore was fortunate that the PM's had such tall with colleagues mostly had a core team very strong ministers supporting him coking Suez Rajaratnam Lim Kim san juan's riesen Osman wok ESM go had a talented team to haunting Joe Tony Tan one can say Akuma Donna Balin Abdul Atta Mooji Giorgio just to name a few if anything yes M ghost team was even more comprehensive than mr. Lee's and when I took over as Prime Minister I inherited ESM goes strong team and mr. Goel himself stayed on and we added talent to his team now he stepped down I rely on my own core team which now also includes several of the four G ministers so the next PM must have and will have his own star WA colleagues to his generation and I hope also younger ones I know everyone is anxious to know who the next PM will be well the leader must command the respect and loyalty of his whole team he must enjoy the support and confidence of the broad mass of Singaporeans and these things take time they cannot be false I do not believe we are ready to settle on a choice yet nor is it helpful to treat this either as a horse race or campaign to lobby support for one or the other candidate this is a team game we want a strong cohesive team so that team Singapore is the winner I have just reassured the cabinet I have moved some ministers to new portfolios I've expanded the responsibilities of others the 4G ministers now helm two thirds of the ministries we have a major say in policies and the direction to take Singapore let's give them the time and space to do their own work to work together in their new roles and to get better known by the public I'm confident that in the fullness of time we will see a clear outcome and a leader will emerge from the process certainly I expect this to happen before the next general election for these 14 years SPM I have been working with a 4G team guiding them assessing them preparing them to take over the reins when Hanks recap rounded up the budget debate this year I was happy to hear him describe the budget as one that not only meets the needs of today's generation but also accounts for the needs of future generations it showed that the 4G ministers understood that their deepest responsibility is to be a steward of Singapore what does it mean steward the government is certainly not the owner of Singapore but neither is it just the manager of Singapore it is the steward it's responsible for taking good care of the country for holding it in trust building up and handing it on in due time to future generations the government must keep faith with past generations who gifted this country to us it has to be responsible to the present generation who continue to build on what we have inherited but above all it must consider future generations whose lives and whose futures depend on us on us the present generation depend on us thinking of their interests acting on their behalf making wise and farsighted decisions to cause Singapore to endure and to flourish for many more years I'm confident that when the time comes for me to hand over to a new prime minister Singapore will be put into the hands of good stewards we've built something truly special here in Singapore countries near and far look to Singapore is a model of governance and development people who want to live here do business here even the US and the DPRK are planning to hold their meeting here in many other countries political leaders plan only up to the next election or the next crisis but in Singapore we are able to think beyond the immediate beyond ourselves we care about our community our country and our future our religious leaders they visit temples churches mosques together they give blessings on one another's milestone celebrations our neighbors and friends invite us over for makan during Chinese New Year Deepavali or Hari Raya our youth travel and experience the world they come back eager to apply what they have seen and learnt around the world back home our grandparents and our parents bring us up and nurture us they are living examples of how by working hard we can build better lives for ourselves and our children so we are all living the Singapore story keeping it alive we must sustain and pass on this shared vision of prospering together progressing together that way we will make this little red dot shine bright in the world as well as in our hearts for many many years to come Thank You mr. speaker mr. Lukic on speakers a lot of signification from the pipe Minister given that the 4G dealership especially the three frontrunners for the next Prime Minister's Bloodshy come from the SAF or the Civil Service does it not a cider dice novel political elite crossing Singapore mr. speaker sir this is an example of the way not to think about the problem when you look at the person you ask is he making a contribution what are his strengths and weaknesses what are his contributions does he or does he not measure up you don't ask where did he come from who his parents are is it bad to come from the civil service or the SAF no is it necessary to come from there no is it good to have people from a wide range yes and we do have a wide range he talked about three frontrunners I don't know how many people are running I just said it's not a horse race it's a team I have people from the private sector I have doctors I have lawyers I have brought in new people from the back benches some of whom also from the private sector business experience so we are looking for people wherever we can find them to bring in to form a Singapore team and the stronger this team is the harder I make mr. Lowe stop and I can't help it it wasn't my objective I just want the best team for Singapore
