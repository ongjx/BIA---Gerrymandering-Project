mr. Deputy Speaker president Halima yaku took her oath of office on 14th September 2017 president Halima is a popular figure who is well respected in many circles she was also my former member of parliament who worked hard to serve her constituents yet despite her personal attributes the lightning circumstances under which this government installed her as the head of state have left Singaporeans reeling in its wake in the immediate aftermath of announcing this year's presidential election as reserved for Malay candidates the media reports highlighted how the public embraced the move with open arms welcoming a Malay president after a break for 46 years yet as the dust started to settle it was clear that the public was very divided over this issue at public discussion forums such as the one organised by the Institute of Public Policy Studies in on 8 September law professors and retired politicians raised legal issues and share adverse public opinions on the matter social media exploded in critique and satire indeed in the past few days it seems to me that the top government leaders have been going into overdrive trying hard to convince Singaporeans that the elected presidency is an integral pillar of Singapore's commitment to multiracialism the government now appears to be well aware of the unhappiness on the ground caused by his maneuvers to install president Halima so this motion does not seek to deal with the wider issues of the presidency nor multiracialism which are worthy of much longer airtime neither is it my purpose to go into the legal arguments some of which have been aired in our courts in July this portion focuses on the parliamentary debates and only one aspect of those debates what did the government tell Parliament was the basis for counting reserved presidential elections under the hiatus triggered model and was what the government told Parliament accurate to cut to the chase did the Prime Minister Deputy Prime Minister tio Ji Heon and Minister Chan too insane make misleading statements to the house that the question of which president to come from was a legal question did the government all along make a policy decision itself to confront president we came we did the government merely used the agency's advice as a cover to avoid full parliamentary debate on why the count was not starting from President or King John to answer this question it is necessary to start with what happened in November during the debate on the Constitution amendment bill during that debate on 18 November the Prime Minister told the house the following and I quote the symbolic role of the president is just as important as his custodial role as a symbol of the nation the race of the candidate is relevant so while individually a good candidate of any race will be satisfactory collectively over a period of time we need that mix of presidents of different races and the election mechanism must be designed to produce such a mix over time this is what the hiatus triggered model delivers when should the racial provision start counting the constitutional amendment bill states that the government should legislate on this point the government intends to legislate when we amend the presidential elections act in January next year we have taken the Attorney General's advice we will start counting from the first president who exercised the powers of the elected president in other words dr. we canwe that means we are now in the fifth term of the elected presidency therefore by the operation of the hiatus triggered model the next election due next year 2017 will be a reserved election for male candidates that was the Prime Minister speech unquote sir the clear impression given to members was that the government's decision to come from president Rhee Kamui was based on the agencies advice that must have been why the Prime Minister sequence the sentences as he did that having taken the AGC advise the government was counting the five terms from President McHenry the Prime Minister did not say that the government intended to count from president we canwe and that the AGC had merely confirmed that it was acceptable to do so sir it seems that the media had a similar impression in a Channel News Asia report on 8 November 2016 there was a headline which read as follows reporting on the debate and I quote next presidential election to be reserved for male candidates PM Lee says the government has taken the Attorney General's advise that racial provisions in the review of the elected presidency will start counting from dr. weak envy that was the headline the impression that it was the AGC who advised the government to count from President Lee was perpetuated the next day 9th November by DP MTO ji Heon during clarification time I rose to expressly recall that the PM had said that the decision to count from dr. week him.we was based on the Attorney General's chambers advice on how to count the terms I asked whether the government was prepared to publish their advice DPM Q did not reply immediately after a cabinet huddle DP MTO eventually rose and responded as follows on the reserve elections and how to count I would like to confirm that this is indeed the Attorney General's chambers advice and if not and you do not think that is correct I think it is possible if you wish to challenge judicially let me repeat what I said on the reserve elections and how to come I would like to confirm that this is indeed the Attorney General's chambers advice and if not and you do not think that is correct I think it's possible if you wish to challenge judicially unquote Deputy Speaker sir any reasonable person hearing those words would assume the following one that the AGC had advised the government how to count do that the agency's advice involved a question of law why else would I be asked to challenge it judicially as the debate went on I was asked whether I was suggesting that the PM had falsely told the house that such was the advice of the AGC I repeated that my interest wasn't asking for the agency's advice to be published DPM tio then told the house that he would ask the prime minister to consider publishing the advice three months later on 6 February this house held the second reading debate on the presidential elections amendment bill what struck me in preparing for the debate was that the bill contained a new schedule with the table stipulating that the count was to start from president we canwe it dawn on me then that the government had simply wanted Parliament to make new law to stipulate that the count should start from president we canwe it was completely a government decision when I put it to the government that counting from president we canwe was an arbitrary and deliberate decision to achieve a desired outcome Minister Chen Xuan Singh rejected my assertion he told the house that the government had decided not to publish the agency's advice mr. Chan for the same coat the government is confident of the advice rendered by the Attorney General we proceeded on that basis during the debates on the constitutional changes in this house Prime Minister Lee explained to all why we needed the hiatus trigger mechanism and he passed the Constitution amendment bill we are here today to put the nuts and bolts in place for a decision made clear by the prime minister during the debates in November and we will not go through this again he continued ms lim once again questioned the Attorney General's advice I'm a bit bewildered by this I would like to clarify a is miss Lim suggesting that the Attorney General did not give the government the appropriate advice or be that the Prime Minister has not been truthful with the Attorney General's advice if it is the first then I think miss Lim as suggested by Deputy Prime Minister to can challenge this in the courts but if it is the second then I'm afraid it is a very serious issue to cast aspersions on the integrity of all prime minister unquote so we should not what happened here instead of confirming that it was the government who made the decision to count from president we Minister Chung explicitly said that the government was confident of the agency's advice and proceeded on that basis to make the constitutional changes she said he did not want to reopen the debate on the count from president we even though Parliament was then asked for the first time to enact the table stipulating the count from president V here we were debating a law that would practically rewrite history by deeming president Wei as the first elected president yet instead of the government using the opportunity to clarify the meta and any misimpressions created it chose instead to impute sinister intentions to me and that was how the parliamentary debates on the reserve presidential elections ended sir with this background we now turn to what happened next in the court proceedings brought by former presidential election candidate dr. pan Chang book in high court originating summons number four nine five of 2017 dr. tan sought a declaration from the court that the amendment to the presidential elections Act in February to count from president week in Wii was unconstitutional in other words his case was that Parliament had passed an unconstitutional law in February when it legislated the schedule to the presidential elections Act with the table the counter hiatus from president be sir prior to commencing his case dr. tan had obtained the opinion of a prominent Queen's Counsel in London considered an expert on Westminster model constitutional law the advice received was that Parliament's amendment to the presidential elections act to count reserved presidential elections from dr. Wickham Wii was unconstitutional the basis for this opinion was that one had to read the Constitution in a purposive manner that is the Constitution should be interpreted in a way that furthers its purpose since the purpose of the constitutional amendment was to cure the problem of five presidential elections not turning out a candidate from a particular ethnic community counting from president we did not make sense since he was never elected this would mean that it was proper to count only from president on King Kong or later if that were to be done this year's presidential election would still be open to candidates of all communities sir although dr. tans case has now been dismissed by the Court of Appeal what is most telling is the stand taken by the AGC in the case Deputy Attorney General mr. Hari Kumar the former PAP MP represented the government he made the following submissions to the court before the High Court on 29 June 2017 the deputy AG said and I quote the Prime Minister never said that the AG advised PM to start the count from president v1 PM said is that the AG advised that what the government was proposing to do was legitimate this is from the official court transcript mr. Kumar further submitted that the decision on which President to come from was a policy matter for the government and not a legal question he argued and I quote the AG was in no position to tell the government where to start the count from and call on 31st July before the Court of Appeal of five judges the deputy AG repeated his position even more vividly he submitted that the agency's advice was irrelevant he also tried to explain away the PM speech on taking the AGC s advice he said in a code one should not look at speeches like statutory instruments the PM had made it clear from his speech that president we was not a popularly elected president but a president who exercised the powers of an elected president then he says fifth term of elected president a convenient term used in his speech he wasn't defining presidency in this context as elected presidency there was mr. Neyers submission to the court sir I was in court when he made that submission which to me was astonishing was the Deputy Attorney General saying that we should not take the PM's speech literally but loosely not placed too much weight on the terms PM used in making a keynote speech to Parliament to amend the Constitution indeed the deputy AG's submission that the prime minister would use terms for convenience drew some skepticism from one of the judges who remarked from the bench that the Prime Minister was speaking in a parliamentary debate would not refer to the elected president for ease of convenience Deputy Speaker sir the government's reference to the agency's advice has confused MPs and also the cause the minister's kept consistently referring to the agency's advice as the basis for the legislative changes yet the deputy AG says in court that the advice is irrelevant I would like all parties interested to look at the court transcripts to see how the cost struggle with trying to make sense of what the government was saying in Parliament with regard to the agencies advice Deputy Speaker the mysterious agencies advice has still not been produced before Parliament nor the courts I can only assume that revealing the advice would not be useful to the government even if one were to give the benefit of the doubt to the prime minister to assume that the PM speech in November was just ambiguous rather than misleading it is also deeply troubling that nobody from the front bench sought to correct the impression given The ministers must have known that the house understood that the government was acting on the agency's advice on how to count that there were legal questions involved yet nobody came out to clarify that hey actually it was the government who decided to come from we canwe was a policy decision nevertheless we sought the agency's blessing to cover ourselves this was never told to us so as things then the costs have now decided that which president to count from for the reserved presidential election is indeed a policy decision for Parliament the government's handling of the parliamentary debates on the legislative changes for a reserved presidential election has been most unsatisfactory here we are debating changes affecting the highest office in the land yet the government decides to engage in ambiguous language and red herrings we in this house should have been told in no uncertain terms that it was the government that wanted to count from weekend we the government should have defended its own decision on why counting from president we was appropriate it should not have evaded the by using the agency's advice as a distraction and then gone to court to say that the agency's advice was irrelevant sir with the benefit of the additional knowledge from the court case I now think back of the parliamentary debates when the government refused to publish the agency's advice despite repeated requests that the government refused to publish the advice because doing so would have made it clear that the decision to come from president we was initiated by the government and the government alone so bida isn't me the deputy AG has now told us that the agency's advice was merely sought to legitimize what the government itself wanted to do sir the government should have told Parliament directly that counting from president we was its decision and defended the decision on the merits instead it chose to distract and confuse the government's inconsistent explanations would further fuel the suspicions of Singaporeans about the real intention behind the legislative changes that resulted in this year's presidential election being a closed one ministers shamayim Thank You Deputy Speaker I would like to make a few points first the government has been always very clear and upfront on the policy objectives of this hiatus trigger preserved elections framework it has been 46 years since we have had Emily president and our challenge was how to achieve both meritocracy and multiracialism by qualified candidates from different races can regularly be elected to be our head of state when the Prime Minister announced the appointment of the Constitutional Commission to review the elected presidency system he said our president is the head of state he represents all Singaporeans in our multiracial society as such it is important that the minorities have a chance to be elected and that this happens regularly second the government has always been clear that when it comes to the counting it is a policy matter for Parliament to decide and Muslim protests far too much I made this clear upfront in a dialogue session held after the government released its white paper I was asked the following question when would the circuit breaker to hold a reserved election after a racial group has not been represented in presidential office after five continuous terms come into effect what was my reply the most direct answer is actually the government can decide when we put in the bill we can say we wanted to start from this period it is a policy decision the CN he reported it it is still on record the Court of Appeal has confirmed that it was for Parliament to decide miss Lin says she was present she heard at this judge asked that question that was that this was said why didn't you read the judgement there is only one person in this house whom the courts have held to be misleading Parliament and he is not from the PAP only one person after evidence is held Muslim knows whom the High Court held was misleading Parliament so I suppose Muslim knows all about misleading Parliament order the court of appeals judgment makes clear a number of things first the constitutional text is clear that Parliament can choose from any other five terms preceding the 2017 elections second the PM speech in Parliament on the constitutional amendments made it clear that Parliament intended to give itself discretion to specify the last term of president we as a first term to be counted for purposes of deciding whether an election is reserved members can read the pot Muslim quoted from the Prime Minister I don't see anything that same because the point is this and we are not changing history here Muslim is a lawyer she knows this doctor we in the second term exercised to the powers of an elected president there is nothing ambiguous about that that's a matter of clear law Parliament could have started counting from doctor we could have started counting from an earlier president Parliament decided to start from dr. V it was made very clear and it was made very clear as a policy decision but in the context of that for example if we wanted to start from dr. V are there any legal impediments to start counting from dr. V I'm just talking about one question amongst many that can arise there number of questions that can be asked and there were also provisions relating to minority rights and so on and I said that we are asking a G C to advise on a number of questions there was on this I think it's on the CNA transcript so the Prime Minister was entirely right to say we will start counting from here the next elections will be reserved for Malay president and we have taken advice from AGC what miss Lim is saying is that we are stuck we are starting to come from here because of agencies advice and that was never suggested we start counting we are a careful government we make a policy decision but we take advice to see whether there are any impediment and this government as a rule generally does not publish legal opinions that it gets if it can be done according to the law we do it if the law has to be changed to achieve policy objectives we do it and I set it up front well before the parliamentary proceedings and the Prime Minister was totally clear and the Court of Appeal said the Prime Minister was very clear what mr. Kumar said in court is you don't try and take every MPs speech and every minister's speech and then try and interpret it as if it's a statutory interpretation you go back to the legislation and we had a long spiel totally relevant about a Queen's Counsel advice miss lemon knows what happened to the Queen's Counsel advice in court she carefully omits saying anything about that and we know how QC advisors can be obtained what matters is what the Court of Appeal has said and the Court of Appeal has been very clear they said the Prime Minister has been very clear they looked at the proceedings they looked at the legislation this argument that it was unconstitutional doesn't have licked any leg to stand on because Constitution provided for Parliament to legislate and Parliament legislated nobody is suggesting that dr. V was elected it is say untrue there's attributed to the proceedings what is suggested that he was the first person to exercise the powers of an elected president and is there any legal impediment for us to start counting from there and these are questions which others may just decide for themselves but we will usually ask a UC for advice on these things and that's exactly what you know if you look at the context we decide and we checked with a GC prime minister said it DP MTO second day said it and Minister Chan said it a few months later the court of appeal as a matter of law said a Jesus advice is irrelevant Attorney General's chambers also argued in Parliament in court that their advice is irrelevant absolutely so because for the legal question of whether a provision is unconstitutional all constitutional and Muslim really should know about this instead of spending so much time making a point out of nothing the question before the court is this particular provision in the parliamentary or presidential elections Act is that constitutional or unconstitutional what does the court have to do the court has got to look at the constitutional provisions it's got to look at the provisions in the legislation it can have reference to parliamentary debates if the provisions are not clear and decide how it interprets which is what the Court of Appeal did and in that context what one party the government's lawyers told the government or what the other party's lawyers told the other party dr. tan checkbook are completely irrelevant and that's a legal argument Agis he put forward and that is a point that the Court of Appeal also makes but that's quite different from the prime minister in Parliament explaining that look you know these are the steps we have taken we have also taken ages his advice he is telling that to the members it's a truth but it's irrelevant as a matter of law surely you know the difference let me therefore summarize and say this sir mr. Deputy Speaker the government made it clear right from the time when the Prime Minister issued instructions in terms of within cabinet and then set out a letter explaining what he wanted to do the terms of reference and then when the Constitutional Commission was set up he also explained to the public that having a minority representation is an important issue and he wants a Constitutional Commission to consider that issue amongst other issues then we have the constitutional commission's report the government made clear in the white paper exactly what its approach was including on the reserved elections and then we explained it on the ground district by district and I said on record and I'm happy to be shown any other part Muslims suggest that I said something else somewhere else that is quite untrue I am very clear and careful about what I say and I'm happy to be confronted with anything else I might have said I said this is a policy matter for us to decide and we are taking advice on a number of issues I mean I'm paraphrasing because I don't have it in front of me why would I go and say it's a policy matter if I thought it was a pure legal issue so if mrs. Lippman's right then I was misleading fall of Singapore mr. Shanmugam you got 30 seconds thank you sir I will use up to 30 seconds and sit down so we are very clear it's a policy matter and that is on the record Prime Minister took the same position he explained in Parliament we decided but we took a Jesus advice and the next day d PM q and subsequently Minister John took the same positions did anyone say we are going to decide this way because this is the way that AGC has told us that we have to decide I mean that would make no sense because Parliament is sovereign Muslim must know Parliament is sovereign if that's a certain legal profession we can change the law but you know in context you got to read whatever statements are made in the overall context Parliament is sovereign its will this sovereign and the real issue is can we achieve what we want within the current framework of taking this approach or do we need to make some changes I think it's quite clear thank you sir the order the time allowed for the Proceedings has expired I adjourned the house can I please read the Prime Minister's what the Prime Minister actually said and put it on record 30 seconds yes we have taken the Attorney General's advice and we will start counting from the first president who exercised to the powers of the elected president so no rewriting of history here that was mr. Wickham we that means we are now in the fifth term of the elected presidency we will also have to define the race of each of the elected presidents we've had so far there is no practical doubt but as a legal matter we have to define it
