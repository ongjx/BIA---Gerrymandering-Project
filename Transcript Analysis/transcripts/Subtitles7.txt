I will focus my speech on the cost of living a topic which the Workers Party believes deserves closer scrutiny by the government for the remainder of the term and beyond the remaining workers party MPs will address other issues as covered in the addenda to the president's address in the last few years cost of living issues have dominated their headlines and more price rises are on the way with the prospective hike in the goods and services tax in the near future raising anxieties further more than one year ago in the wake of the announcement of a hike in water tariffs Deputy Prime Minister tio tio ji Heon so to assure the public that the price of coffee should not go up in the aftermath of the water hikes because the cost of coffee in a cup of in a cup is much much less than one cent and that the public should not be scared of untrue stories about coffee prices while this is true in a mathematical sense just a few days ago a Chow power report confirmed that one of the largest coffee shop chains had increased the price of coffee citing rising over hits one response to preempt cost-of-living concerns by the government at budget 2018 has been to enhance the GST use a voucher with each eligible household standing to receive five dollars more every three months between 2019 and 2021 to compensate for the recently announced carbon tax the PAP government's philosophy has always been to target assistance for those who govern the fear of overly generous welfare payouts for the able-bodied comes with a warning the message that can be inadvertently sent is that a person is not able to look after himself hence needing support and severely undermining the work ethic Singaporeans should not dismiss this concern but parallel expectations and considerations apply equally for the government - at the committee of supply debate this year the Transport Minister confirmed that Singaporeans can expect to see a rise in transport costs in the very near future - to reflect growing network capacity and ridership but as many callers to a local radio station commented not too long ago the cost of running and improving the transport system cannot just be seen through the eyes of fair revenue many correctly questioned whether there ought to be some school for other segments of SM artists business to subsidize train operations - such as advertising and revenue from other investments to lessen the effect of any fare increases on the general population mr. speaker the question of the quantum of the surpluses and the prospect of alternate revenue streams and future surpluses of many government in companies and stretched tree boards to better cushion price hikes on Singaporeans needs to be looked at very closely and debated before prices go up for example on the 30 percent water hike how do future capital investments in water supply and transmission go here with the large capital reserves of the National Water Agency which have increased consistently from around 3 billion dollars in 2007 to more than 5 billion dollars in 2016 getting into the details of such matters would represent a unique partnership with the people it would represent bold leadership but such an approach would also come with an up shop price hikes are likely to be better understood and contextualized to the benefit of the policy discourse in Singapore mr. speaker the president correctly pointed out that young Singaporeans want to feel a strong sense of nation raising our total fertility rate is an axis existential issue for our nation we know from a recent government survey that many married Singaporean couples actually do wish to have three or more children while 39% felt this was an ideal outcome only 18% were able to actualize it similarly when 53% of couples I beg your pardon while 53% of couples ideally wanted two children only 37% were able to actualize it sixty-one percent of respondents raised financial cost as they are first out of three reasons for not having more children followed closely by the stress of raising children in Singapore at 56% and the difficulty of managing work and family demands at 33% if indeed the cost of living is a major impediment to having more children what can we do to address this issue how will we create a strong sense of nationhood when our Singapore core and the values internalized over 50 years of nation-building are progressively hollowing the selves up with the population not replacing itself sir immigration cannot be the long-term solution to our TFR woes immigration emigration to and we cannot be encouraging even more immigrants to set up home on our shores without a robust strategy to raise the Fr not to do so would severely impact the quality of life in Singapore for future generations in view of our limited size the problem is a structural one and structural changes are necessary and both thinking is required to break with the orthodoxy of the past is there scope to make HDB flats more affordable by pegging prices to income levels and flexible work arrangements become a compulsory option for new parents from employers what can we do to make the education system a reason for parents not to panic about having children is there scope to introduce more child support tax credits for low and medium and medium in parent medium income parents which can be scaled back progressively as household income increases unlike their predecessors the 40 leadership are coming into power when expenditures will rise in concert with the changing demographics of Singapore but that is only half the story on the question of finances the inclusion of the masse into the net investment returns contribution or an IRC framework from 2016 has also put more money and by extension more political capital in the hands of the current government in 4gv days than any generation of PAP leaders this is without having to even call on the President to unlock the reserves to put this in perspective the overall budget surplus for the term of father for this term of government for financial year 2016 and 2017 is currently at fifteen point seven billion dollars and this is after transfers to endowments and trust funds like the GST voucher fund the fifteen point seven billion dollars could potentially cover two more pioneer generation packages of about eight billion dollars each covering almost an additional 1 million more elderly and this is only taking into account the accumulated surplus out of two of the five years of this government's term in comparison the first and only drawdown of the reserves in 2009 requiring presidential approval amounted to 4.9 million dollars for the jobs Credit Scheme which extended a cash grant for every local worker on an on a qualifying employers payroll with a smaller amount allocated to financial institutions for the special risk sharing initiative with fifteen point seven billion dollars in hand today and given the putative least able formula for NRC withdrawals in spite of market fluctuations the picture for the immediate future does not appear to be one of a government needing money to stay afloat or needing to tax the population as a result raising the cost of living we are toll more money is needed for health care and other areas in years to come this is not unexpected given our demographic transition with our elderly population expected to grow to 900,000 by 2030 but what are the government's current estimates and the underlying basis for its projections of high expenditure coming on stream in future this information needs to be shared so that the public are clear-eyed about the sufficiency of the budget at the government's disposal to help Singaporeans with the cost of living today in conclusion sir the president's call not to s to bold changes is not one that should preoccupy the 4g4 generation leadership alone the leadership transition from the 3G to 4G leaders also presents a unique opportunity for each Singaporean to question what we can do to make Singapore better home for all of us the leadership team is no longer just the political leadership Singapore needs a special breadth and depth of leadership if it is to succeed leadership in every field of industry from trade and industry to sports arts and culture if Singapore is to thrive as the immediate geopolitical situation shifts and separately the challenge of an aging society inequality and an extremely low TFR confronts our small country boldness should be part of our national character too at its core the transition from the 3G to 4G leaders must be accompanied by a transformation of our society which creates the conditions to engender a confident people the impetus and authority behind the new bowl since Singaporeans should hearken back to the title of the president's address a call for strong people government partnership to build our future Singapore people who exercise independent judgment and who are empowered to support Singapore and to move forward together finally Mr Speaker I would like to put on record my thanks for Minister Minister Chen Xuan Singh's words on the workers party and mr. Latta Yang's contributions over the years the Workers Party will always bear in mind the national interest in our deliberations and endeavor in the interests of Singaporeans and Singapore thank you
