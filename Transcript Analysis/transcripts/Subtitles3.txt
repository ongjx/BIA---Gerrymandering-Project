let me talk about children of unwed parents and many of you here have spoken up for unwed parents this quick shot en mis mr. Vyse amanha miss miss Dhanalakshmi missed impaling miss Dennis town mr. Lewis own mr. Desmond show you all talked about extending benefits such as maternity leave the CD a first step to unwed parents parity for all singapore children regardless of the parents and marital status i want to recognize especially see our camping in particular who has been urging the ministry for a very long time for number of years to give more help to single parents or particular unwed parents and their children now before I address members concerns I think it's important to say a few things single parents are not I repeat there not a uniform group divorced and widowed single parents form the bulk of single parents they are already eligible for the same Parenthood benefits as Mary parents secondly today government benefits that support the growth and development of children are given to all children regardless of the marital status of their parents like all other children children of unwed parents have access to social assistance education and health care subsidies they are also eligible for infant care and child care subsidies medisave grant for newborns and the foreign domestic help a worker levy concession is also eligible today but I do understand where members are coming from which is why when I first came into MSF I wanted to review this policy because I do meet unwed mothers particularly when they come to see me at em media people session and they are vulnerable usually because they are younger can lower educated some may have been rejected by their own families no it's difficult enough to bring up children but to do so single-handedly without family support that's really tough some may have hoped to have helped to have a child within marriage but due to circumstances ended up as on wet parent I feel that we can do more to support their efforts to care for the children and reduce a disadvantage the children may face out though in fact the earlier example when I talk about kids start I think the children of unwed mothers especially those in a more vulnerable situation will be those that we are reaching out to help hence this is what we will do unwed mothers real benefit from government paid maternity leave will equalize it we will need to amend the legislation obviously to make this happen and this should be able to come into effect for children born from early next year children of unwed parents will qualify for the child development account including the three thousand dollars CDA first step we are in the process of working on the legislation to get it in place as well as the system and huntsmen and this is likely to kick in for children born from the third quarter of this year now these benefits are useful in the child's developmental or caregiving needs they also support the unwed parents efforts to provide for the child at the same time the extension of these benefits to unwed parents it does not undermine Parenthood within marriage which is something that we do encourage and it is still the prevalent social norm and this is other reasons behind this particular decision but on top of this MSF and ncess will work with the relevant vws and agencies to strengthen support for families with vulnerable low-income unwed mothers this is to enable them to make better-informed decisions to improve the financial and family stability and ultimately to enhance the charles outcomes you
