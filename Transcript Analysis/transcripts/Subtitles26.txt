Li said while Singapore has no control over global prices the government has in place several measures to mitigate sharp price spikes and supply disruptions there is no panic in the market because this industry of supply has got many buffers in each of the supply chain so for instance we have our own stock power other countries do and even a supply themselves or the intermediary themselves keep you know a healthy stock level in terms of supply law and Foreign Affairs Minister K Shanmugam says the case involving two Singaporean women who were made to do nude squats when at a johor detention centre would have to be resolved in accordance with Malaysian laws mr.

Warren says unlicensed money lending and harassment reports dropped by more than 20% in the first nine months of this year compared to the same period last year and this can be attributed to tougher laws and stepped up police enforcement mrs.
